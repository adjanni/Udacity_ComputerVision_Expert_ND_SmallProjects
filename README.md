# Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects
This repository show the small projects I am working on while going through the UDACITY Computer Vision Expert Nano Degree.

**Motivation to study CVE Nanodegree**

My aim is to gain knowledge et expertise to work in medical imaging and computer vision to contribute to the diagnostic of melanoma skin cancer in black people.

**What I have learned and done so far?**

**1. Imagee Representation & Classification**

I have learned how images are represented numerically and implemennt image processing, such as color masking and binary classification.

For example, I have built a classifier that can accurately label (about 93 %) these images as day or night, and that relies on finding distinguishing
features between the two types of images! 

You can access the directory of the [project here](https://github.com/adjanni/Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects/tree/master/Small_Projects_Fun/Project1_Build_DayAndNight_Classifier)

**2. Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection**

I have learned about frequency in images and I am now able to implement my own image filters for detecting edges and shapes in an image. 
I am now able to use a computer vision library, Haar cascade classifier, to perform face detection.

**3. Types of Features and Image Segmentation**

I programmed a corner detector and learned techniques, like [k-means clustering](https://github.com/adjanni/Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects/blob/master/Part1_Introduction_to_Computer_Vision/Features_Images_Segmentations/K-means_Clustering_GraphiumPolicnes.ipynb), 
and [for segmentating an image into unique parts](https://github.com/adjanni/Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects/blob/master/Part1_Introduction_to_Computer_Vision/Features_Images_Segmentations/Untitled.ipynb).

**4. Features Vectors**

I learned how to describe objects and images using feature vectors.

I did this very interesting image based analysis using ORB. The aim was to analyse build a classifier to identifier my brother on our picture
... here is the [link](https://github.com/adjanni/Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects/blob/master/Part1_Introduction_to_Computer_Vision/Features_Vectors/Implementing_ORB.ipynb).

**5. CNN Layers and Feature Visualization**

In this part, I defined and trained my own convolution neural network for clothing recognition. I have also used feature visualization techniques to see what a network has learned.

I designed two convolutional layers (CL) with a maxpooling layer at the end of each CL. All of them were connected with two fully-connected linear layer.
With an accuracy of 86%, the model performs well on everything but shorts and pullovers. I suggested ways to increase the accuracy. 
The challenging project can be found here: [CNN_Clothing_Classification](https://github.com/adjanni/Udacity_ComputerVision_Expert_ND_SmallProjects/blob/master/Small_Projects_Fun/Project3_Build_CNN_Fashion_Clothings_Classification/FirstCNN%20Deep_Learning_CNN_for_Fashion-MNIST_Clothing_Classification.ipynb)

** Project: Facial KeyPoint Detection**
I am currently workinh on this project. The aim is to apply my knowledge of image processing and deep learning to create a CNN for facial keypoint (eyes, mouth, nose, etc.) detection.

I am will update and push in my project once I get the feedback from the UDACITY's reviewers...
