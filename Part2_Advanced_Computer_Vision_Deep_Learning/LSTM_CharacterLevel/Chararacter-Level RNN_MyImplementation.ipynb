      "absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his\n",

      "respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme\n",

      "shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism--not the liberalism he\n",

      "virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the\n",
      "same, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly--the most\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, let's go into my room,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his\n",

      "him along, as though guiding him through dangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his\n",
      "acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names:\n",
      "old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and\n",
      "adjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found\n",
      "at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much\n",
      "surprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky,\n",
      "something in common. He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he\n",
      "took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with\n",
      "everyone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums,\n",
      "as he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his\n",
      "subordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to\n",
      "diminish the disagreeable impression made on them. Levin was not a\n",
      "disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin\n",
      "fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his\n",
      "subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not\n",
      "rest merely on champagne. Levin had been the friend and companion of his\n",
      "early youth. They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of\n",
      "their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have\n",
      "been together in early youth. But in spite of this, each of them--as is\n",
      "often the way with men who have selected careers of different\n",
      "kinds--though in discussion he would even justify the other's career, in\n",
      "his heart despised it. It seemed to each of them that the life he led\n",
      "himself was the only real life, and the life led by his friend was a\n",
      "mere phantasm. Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the\n",
      "sight of Levin. How often he had seen him come up to Moscow from the\n",
      "country where he was doing something, but what precisely Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he took no interest\n",
      "in the matter. Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and in a hurry,\n",
      "rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease, and for the\n",
      "most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of things. Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it. In the same way Levin in his\n",
      "heart despised the town mode of life of his friend, and his official\n",
      "duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling. But the\n",
      "difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as every one did,\n",
      "laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed without\n",
      "complacency and sometimes angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have long been expecting you,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into\n",
      "his room and letting Levin's hand go as though to show that here all\n",

      "\n",
      "Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky's two\n",

      "had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and\n",
      "such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed\n",
      "all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought. Oblonsky\n",
      "noticed this at once, and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,\" he said. \"My colleagues: Philip\n",

      "to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as\n",
      "Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with them\n",

      "why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a long story. I will tell you some time,\" said Levin, but he began\n",
      "telling him at once. \"Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced that\n",
      "nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could be,\" he\n",
      "began, as though some one had just insulted him. \"On one side it's a\n",
      "plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I'm neither young enough\n",
      "nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the other side\"\n",
      "(he stammered) \"it's a means for the coterie of the district to make\n",

      "district council--not in the form of bribes, but in the form of unearned\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, later. But I wanted to see you,\" said Levin, looking with hatred\n",

      "ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and\n",
      "blushing still more, almost to the point of tears. And it was so strange\n",
      "to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight, that\n",

      "ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues. All\n",

      "\n",
      "It was a bright, frosty day. Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and\n",

      "vestments.\n",

      "He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to\n",
      "himself--\"You mustn't be excited, you must be calm. What's the matter\n",
      "with you? What do you want? Be quiet, stupid,\" he conjured his heart.\n",
      "And the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found\n",
      "himself. An acquaintance met him and called him by his name, but Levin\n",
      "did not even recognize him. He went towards the mounds, whence came the\n",
      "clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up,\n",
      "the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices. He\n",
      "walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes,\n",
      "and at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his\n",
      "heart. She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the\n",
      "ground. There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her\n",
      "attitude. But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose\n",
      "among nettles. Everything was made bright by her. She was the smile that\n",
      "shed light on all round her. \"Is it possible I can go over there on the\n",
      "ice, go up to her?\" he thought. The place where she stood seemed to him\n",
      "a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he was\n",
      "almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror. He had to make an\n",
      "effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people of all sorts\n",
      "were moving about her, and that he too might come there to skate. He\n",
      "walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun, but\n",
      "seeing her, as one does the sun, without looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all\n",
      "acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice. There were crack\n",
      "skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs\n",
      "with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with\n",
      "hygienic motives. They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings\n",
      "because they were here, near her. All the skaters, it seemed, with\n",
      "perfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke\n",
      "to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice\n",
      "and the fine weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty's cousin, in a short jacket and tight\n",
      "trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on. Seeing Levin,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate ice--do put\n",
      "your skates on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't got my skates,\" Levin answered, marveling at this boldness\n",
      "and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her,\n",
      "though he did not look at her. He felt as though the sun were coming\n",
      "near him. She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in their\n",
      "high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him. A boy in\n",
      "Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground,\n",
      "overtook her. She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of\n",
      "the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency,\n",
      "and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him,\n",
      "and at her own fears. When she had got round the turn, she gave herself\n",
      "a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky.\n",
      "Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin. She was more splendid\n",
      "than he had imagined her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to\n",
      "himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on\n",
      "the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and\n",
      "good humor. The childishness of her expression, together with the\n",
      "delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he\n",
      "fully realized. But what always struck him in her as something unlooked\n",
      "for, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and\n",
      "above all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted\n",
      "world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered\n",
      "himself in some days of his early childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you been here long?\" she said, giving him her hand. \"Thank you,\"\n",

      "muff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? I've not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I arrived,\"\n",

      "with what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome\n",
      "with confusion and blushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you could skate, and skate so well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of\n",
      "his confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that you are\n",
      "the best of skaters,\" she said, with her little black-gloved hand\n",
      "brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do everything with passion, I think,\" she said smiling. \"I should\n",
      "so like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us skate together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Skate together! Can that be possible?\" thought Levin, gazing at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll put them on directly,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he went off to get skates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a long while since we've seen you here, sir,\" said the attendant,\n",
      "supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate. \"Except you,\n",
      "there's none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters. Will that be all\n",
      "right?\" said he, tightening the strap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,\" answered Levin, with difficulty\n",
      "restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face. \"Yes,\"\n",
      "he thought, \"this now is life, this is happiness! _Together,_ she said;\n",
      "_let us skate together!_ Speak to her now? But that's just why I'm\n",
      "afraid to speak--because I'm happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And\n",
      "then?.... But I must! I must! I must! Away with weakness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the\n",
      "rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without\n",
      "effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and\n",
      "slackening speed and turning his course. He approached with timidity,\n",
      "but again her smile reassured him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and\n",
      "faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,\" she\n",
      "said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,\" he said,\n",
      "but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed. And\n",
      "indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like the\n",
      "sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and Levin\n",
      "detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working\n",
      "of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there anything troubling you?--though I've no right to ask such a\n",
      "question,\" he added hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, why so?.... No, I have nothing to trouble me,\" she responded\n",
      "coldly; and she added immediately: \"You haven't seen Mlle. Linon, have\n",
      "you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!\" thought Levin, and he\n",
      "flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting\n",
      "on a bench. Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted him as an\n",
      "old friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you see we're growing up,\" she said to him, glancing towards\n",
      "Kitty, \"and growing old. _Tiny bear_ has grown big now!\" pursued the\n",
      "Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three\n",
      "young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English\n",
      "nursery tale. \"Do you remember that's what you used to call them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke\n",
      "for ten years now, and was fond of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely,\n",
      "hasn't she?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes\n",
      "looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin\n",
      "fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate\n",
      "composure. And he felt depressed. After talking a little of her old\n",
      "governess and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren't you?\" she\n",
      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm not dull, I am very busy,\" he said, feeling that she was\n",
      "holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the\n",
      "force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the\n",
      "winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going to stay in town long?\" Kitty questioned him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" he answered, not thinking of what he was saying. The\n",
      "thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness\n",
      "he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his\n",
      "mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it you don't know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. It depends upon you,\" he said, and was immediately\n",
      "horror-stricken at his own words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to\n",
      "hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly\n",
      "skated away from him. She skated up to Mlle. Linon, said something to\n",
      "her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their\n",
      "skates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,\" said Levin,\n",
      "praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of violent\n",
      "exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day,\n",
      "came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in his\n",
      "mouth. Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing\n",
      "and bounding up and down. He flew down, and without even changing the\n",
      "position of his hands, skated away over the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, that's a new trick!\" said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top\n",
      "to do this new trick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't break your neck! it needs practice!\" Nikolay Shtcherbatsky\n",
      "shouted after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and\n",
      "dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his\n",
      "hands. On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with\n",
      "his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off,\n",
      "laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How splendid, how nice he is!\" Kitty was thinking at that time, as she\n",
      "came out of the pavilion with Mlle. Linon, and looked towards him with a\n",
      "smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother. \"And can\n",
      "it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong? They talk of flirtation.\n",
      "I know it's not he that I love; but still I am happy with him, and he's\n",
      "so jolly. Only, why did he say that?...\" she mused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the\n",
      "steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered\n",
      "a minute. He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter\n",
      "at the entrance of the gardens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Delighted to see you,\" said Princess Shtcherbatskaya. \"On Thursdays we\n",
      "are home, as always.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We shall be pleased to see you,\" the princess said stiffly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth\n",
      "over her mother's coldness. She turned her head, and with a smile said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye till this evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with\n",
      "beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.\n",
      "But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and\n",
      "crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly's health. After a little\n",
      "subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out\n",
      "his chest again, and put his arm in Levin's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, shall we set off?\" he asked. \"I've been thinking about you all\n",
      "this time, and I'm very, very glad you've come,\" he said, looking him in\n",
      "the face with a significant air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, come along,\" answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the\n",
      "sound of that voice saying, \"Good-bye till this evening,\" and seeing the\n",
      "smile with which it was said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the England or the Hermitage?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind which.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, the England,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting that\n",
      "restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and\n",
      "consequently considered it mean to avoid it. \"Have you got a sledge?\n",
      "That's first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The friends hardly spoke all the way. Levin was wondering what that\n",
      "change in Kitty's expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself\n",
      "that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his\n",
      "hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite another\n",
      "man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words,\n",
      "\"Good-bye till this evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu\n",
      "of the dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You like turbot, don't you?\" he said to Levin as they were arriving.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh?\" responded Levin. \"Turbot? Yes, I'm _awfully_ fond of turbot.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help\n",
      "noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained\n",
      "radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked\n",
      "into the dining room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were\n",
      "clustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins. Bowing to right\n",
      "and left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting\n",
      "acquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer\n",
      "of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in\n",
      "ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing\n",
      "that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter. Levin for his\n",
      "part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a\n",
      "loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,\n",
      "_poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_. He made haste to move away\n",
      "from her, as from a dirty place. His whole soul was filled with memories\n",
      "of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won't be disturbed\n",
      "here,\" said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with\n",
      "immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind. \"Walk in, your\n",
      "excellency,\" he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze\n",
      "chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up\n",
      "velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with\n",
      "a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free\n",
      "directly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! oysters.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How if we were to change our program, Levin?\" he said, keeping his\n",
      "finger on the bill of fare. And his face expressed serious hesitation.\n",
      "\"Are the oysters good? Mind now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're Flensburg, your excellency. We've no Ostend.\"\n",

      "\"Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only arrived yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the\n",
      "whole program? Eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge better\n",
      "than anything; but of course there's nothing like that here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Porridge a la Russe,_ your honor would like?\" said the Tatar, bending\n",
      "down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I've been\n",
      "skating, and I'm hungry. And don't imagine,\" he added, detecting a look\n",
      "of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky's face, \"that I shan't appreciate your\n",
      "choice. I am fond of good things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should hope so! After all, it's one of the pleasures of life,\" said\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"Well, then, my friend, you give us two--or better\n",
      "say three--dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Printaniere,_\" prompted the Tatar. But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently\n",
      "did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names of\n",
      "the dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce, then ...\n",
      "roast beef; and mind it's good. Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then\n",
      "sweets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch's way not to\n",
      "call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat\n",
      "them after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to\n",
      "himself according to the bill:--\"_Soupe printaniere, turbot, sauce\n",
      "Beaumarchais, poulard a l'estragon, macedoine de fruits_ ... etc.,\" and\n",
      "then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill\n",
      "of fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we drink?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What you like, only not too much. Champagne,\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! to start with? You're right though, I dare say. Do you like the\n",
      "white seal?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Cachet blanc,_\" prompted the Tatar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we'll\n",
      "see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. And what table wine?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. And _your_ cheese, your excellency?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's all the same to me,\" said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted\n",
      "in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle\n",
      "between his fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his\n",
      "waistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not bad,\" he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a\n",
      "silver fork, and swallowing them one after another. \"Not bad,\" he\n",
      "repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have\n",
      "pleased him better. But he was admiring Oblonsky. Even the Tatar,\n",
      "uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate\n",
      "glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat\n",
      "with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't care much for oysters, do you?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n",
      "emptying his wine glass, \"or you're worried about something. Eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted Levin to be in good spirits. But it was not that Levin was not\n",
      "in good spirits; he was ill at ease. With what he had in his soul, he\n",
      "felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private\n",
      "rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle;\n",
      "the surroundings of bronzes, looking glasses, gas, and waiters--all of\n",
      "it was offensive to him. He was afraid of sullying what his soul was\n",
      "brimful of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,\" he said. \"You can't\n",
      "conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer as\n",
      "that gentleman's nails I saw at your place...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch's nails,\"\n",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too much for me,\" responded Levin. \"Do try, now, and put yourself\n",
      "in my place, take the point of view of a country person. We in the\n",
      "country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most\n",
      "convenient for working with. So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up\n",
      "our sleeves. And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as\n",
      "they will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can\n",
      "do nothing with their hands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, that's just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work. His\n",
      "work is with the mind...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe. But still it's queer to me, just as at this moment it seems\n",
      "queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as\n",
      "we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to drag\n",
      "out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating\n",
      "oysters...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, of course,\" objected Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"But that's just the aim\n",
      "of civilization--to make everything a source of enjoyment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that's its aim, I'd rather be a savage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin sighed. He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and\n",
      "sore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at\n",
      "once drew his attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys', I\n",
      "mean?\" he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the\n",
      "empty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I shall certainly go,\" replied Levin; \"though I fancied the\n",
      "princess was not very warm in her invitation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What nonsense! That's her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!.... That's\n",
      "her manner--_grande dame,_\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"I'm coming, too,\n",
      "but I have to go to the Countess Bonina's rehearsal. Come, isn't it true\n",
      "that you're a savage? How do you explain the sudden way in which you\n",
      "vanished from Moscow? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me\n",
      "about you, as though I ought to know. The only thing I know is that you\n",
      "always do what no one else does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Levin, slowly and with emotion, \"you're right. I am a\n",
      "savage. Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming\n",
      "now. Now I have come...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!\" broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch, looking\n",
      "into Levin's eyes.\n",

      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,\n",

      "\"No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is mine,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, every girl, but not she.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled. He so well knew that feeling of Levin's,\n",
      "that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes:\n",
      "one class--all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with\n",
      "all sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right, but do sit down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Levin could not sit down. He walked with his firm tread twice up and\n",

      "\n",

      "it's not that. It's not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has\n",
      "taken possession of me. I went away, you see, because I made up my mind\n",
      "that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not\n",

      "done for me by what you said. I'm so happy that I've become positively\n",
      "hateful; I've forgotten everything. I heard today that my brother\n",
      "Nikolay ... you know, he's here ... I had even forgotten him. It seems\n",
      "to me that he's happy too. It's a sort of madness. But one thing's\n",
      "awful.... Here, you've been married, you know the feeling ... it's awful\n",
      "that we--old--with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are brought\n",
      "all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it's loathsome, and\n",

      "my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato\n",
      "defines in his Banquet, served as the test of men. Some men only\n",
      "understand one sort, and some only the other. And those who only know\n",
      "the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy. In such love\n",
      "there can be no sort of tragedy. 'I'm much obliged for the\n",
      "gratification, my humble respects'--that's all the tragedy. And in\n",

      "character that's all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be of\n",
      "a piece too--but that's not how it is. You despise public official work\n",

      "the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with\n",
      "her husband than she had over the elder girls. The old prince, like all\n",
      "fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor\n",
      "and reputation of his daughters. He was irrationally jealous over his\n",
      "daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his favorite. At every turn he\n",
      "had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter. The princess\n",
      "had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now\n",
      "she felt that there was more ground for the prince's touchiness. She saw\n",
      "that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a\n",
      "mother's duties had become still more difficult. She saw that girls of\n",
      "Kitty's age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures,\n",
      "mixed freely in men's society; drove about the streets alone, many of\n",
      "them did not curtsey, and, what was the most important thing, all the\n",
      "girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own\n",
      "affair, and not their parents'. \"Marriages aren't made nowadays as they\n",
      "used to be,\" was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by\n",
      "their elders. But how marriages were made now, the princess could not\n",
      "learn from any one. The French fashion--of the parents arranging their\n",
      "children's future--was not accepted; it was condemned. The English\n",
      "fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted, and\n",
      "not possible in Russian society. The Russian fashion of match-making by\n",
      "the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered\n",
      "unseemly; it was ridiculed by every one, and by the princess herself.\n",
      "But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no\n",
      "one knew. Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the\n",
      "matter said the same thing: \"Mercy on us, it's high time in our day to\n",
      "cast off all that old-fashioned business. It's the young people have to\n",
      "marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people\n",
      "to arrange it as they choose.\" It was very easy for anyone to say that\n",
      "who had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of\n",
      "getting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in\n",
      "love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit\n",
      "to be her husband. And, however much it was instilled into the princess\n",
      "that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for\n",
      "themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have been\n",
      "unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable\n",
      "playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols. And\n",
      "so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her\n",
      "elder sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting\n",
      "with her daughter. She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but\n",
      "tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man,\n",
      "and would not do this. But at the same time she knew how easy it is,\n",
      "with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl's head, and how\n",
      "lightly men generally regard such a crime. The week before, Kitty had\n",
      "told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a mazurka.\n",
      "This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at\n",
      "ease she could not be. Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his\n",
      "brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up\n",
      "their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her. \"And\n",
      "just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother's arrival from Petersburg,\n",
      "as peculiarly fortunate,\" he told her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.\n",
      "But her mother saw them in a different light. She knew that the old lady\n",
      "was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son's\n",
      "choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer\n",
      "through fear of vexing his mother. However, she was so anxious for the\n",
      "marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she\n",
      "believed it was so. Bitter as it was for the princess to see the\n",
      "unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her\n",
      "husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter's fate\n",
      "engrossed all her feelings. Today, with Levin's reappearance, a fresh\n",
      "source of anxiety arose. She was afraid that her daughter, who had at\n",
      "one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense\n",
      "of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin's arrival might generally\n",
      "complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, has he been here long?\" the princess asked about Levin, as they\n",
      "returned home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He came today, mamma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's one thing I want to say...\" began the princess, and from her\n",
      "serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma,\" she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, \"please,\n",
      "please don't say anything about that. I know, I know all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her\n",
      "mother's wishes wounded her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only want to say that to raise hopes...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mamma, darling, for goodness' sake, don't talk about it. It's so\n",
      "horrible to talk about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't,\" said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter's eyes;\n",
      "\"but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from\n",
      "me. You won't?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never, mamma, none,\" answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking her\n",
      "mother straight in the face, \"but there's no use in my telling you\n",
      "anything, and I ... I ... if I wanted to, I don't know what to say or\n",
      "how ... I don't know...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,\" thought the mother,\n",
      "smiling at her agitation and happiness. The princess smiled that what\n",
      "was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so\n",
      "immense and so important.\n",

      "After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a\n",
      "sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle. Her\n",
      "heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first\n",
      "time, would be a turning point in her life. And she was continually\n",
      "picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both\n",
      "together. When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with\n",
      "tenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin. The memories of\n",
      "childhood and of Levin's friendship with her dead brother gave a special\n",
      "poetic charm to her relations with him. His love for her, of which she\n",
      "felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it was pleasant\n",
      "for her to think of Levin. In her memories of Vronsky there always\n",
      "entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the highest\n",
      "degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false note--not\n",
      "in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself, while with\n",
      "Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear. But, on the other hand,\n",
      "directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her\n",
      "a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed\n",
      "misty.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she\n",
      "noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in\n",
      "complete possession of all her forces,--she needed this so for what lay\n",
      "before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in\n",
      "her movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room,\n",
      "when the footman announced, \"Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.\" The\n",
      "princess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in. \"So it\n",
      "is to be,\" thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart.\n",
      "She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the\n",
      "looking-glass. At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come\n",
      "early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer. And only\n",
      "then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new,\n",
      "different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not\n",
      "affect her only--with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved--but\n",
      "that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked. And to\n",
      "wound him cruelly. What for? Because he, dear fellow, loved her, was in\n",
      "love with her. But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would\n",
      "have to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?\" she thought. \"Can\n",
      "I tell him I don't love him? That will be a lie. What am I to say to\n",
      "him? That I love someone else? No, that's impossible. I'm going away,\n",
      "I'm going away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She had reached the door, when she heard his step. \"No! it's not honest.\n",
      "What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What is to be,\n",
      "will be! I'll tell the truth. And with him one can't be ill at ease.\n",
      "Here he is,\" she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy figure, with\n",
      "his shining eyes fixed on her. She looked straight into his face, as\n",
      "though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not time yet; I think I'm too early,\" he said glancing round the\n",
      "empty drawing room. When he saw that his expectations were realized,\n",
      "that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became\n",
      "gloomy.\n",

      "what he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said,\n",
      "he stopped short and looked at her...\n",
      "\n",
      "She was breathing heavily, not looking at him. She was feeling ecstasy.\n",
      "Her soul was flooded with happiness. She had never anticipated that the\n",
      "utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her. But it\n",
      "lasted only an instant. She remembered Vronsky. She lifted her clear,\n",

      "\"That cannot be ... forgive me.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was bound to be so,\" he said, not looking at her.\n",

      "\n",
      "But at that very moment the princess came in. There was a look of horror\n",
      "on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces. Levin\n",
      "bowed to her, and said nothing. Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes.\n",
      "\"Thank God, she has refused him,\" thought the mother, and her face\n",
      "lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on\n",
      "Thursdays. She sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in\n",
      "the country. He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to arrive, in\n",

      "\n",
      "Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty's, married the\n",
      "preceding winter, Countess Nordston.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black\n",

      "the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to\n",
      "make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she\n",
      "wanted her to marry Vronsky. Levin she had often met at the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys' early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.\n",
      "Her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making\n",

      "\"I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,\n",
      "or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I'm a fool, or is\n",
      "condescending to me. I like that so; to see him condescending! I am so\n",
      "glad he can't bear me,\" she used to say of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her\n",
      "for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic--her\n",
      "nervousness, her delicate contempt and indifference for everything\n",
      "coarse and earthly.\n",

      "The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another\n",
      "not seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on\n",

      "even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each\n",
      "other.\n",

      "The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch! So you've come back to our corrupt\n",

      "well,\" responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure,\n",

      "And she began talking to Kitty. Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw\n",
      "now, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this\n",
      "awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at\n",
      "him now and then and avoided his eyes. He was on the point of getting\n",
      "up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you be long in Moscow? You're busy with the district council,\n",
      "though, aren't you, and can't be away for long?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, princess, I'm no longer a member of the council,\" he said. \"I have\n",
      "come up for a few days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's something the matter with him,\" thought Countess Nordston,\n",

      "Kitty, and I'll do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Konstantin Dmitrievitch,\" she said to him, \"do explain to me, please,\n",
      "what's the meaning of it. You know all about such things. At home in our\n",
      "village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all\n",
      "they possessed, and now they can't pay us any rent. What's the meaning\n",
      "of that? You always praise the peasants so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can't tell\n",
      "you anything,\" he said, and looked round at the officer who came in\n",
      "behind the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be Vronsky,\" thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced at\n",
      "Kitty. She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round at\n",
      "Levin. And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously\n",
      "brighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if\n",
      "she had told him so in words. But what sort of a man was he? Now,\n",
      "whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must\n",
      "find out what the man was like whom she loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what,\n",
      "are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and\n",
      "to see only what is bad. There are people, on the other hand, who desire\n",
      "above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has\n",
      "outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is\n",
      "good. Levin belonged to the second class. But he had no difficulty in\n",
      "finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky. It was apparent at the\n",
      "first glance. Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall,\n",
      "with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.\n",
      "Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair\n",
      "and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform,\n",
      "was simple and at the same time elegant. Making way for the lady who had\n",
      "come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender\n",
      "light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it\n",
      "seemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held\n",
      "out his small broad hand to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once\n",
      "glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let me introduce you,\" said the princess, indicating Levin. \"Konstantin\n",

      "\"My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them so\n",
      "well,\" said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the\n",
      "same thing before, he reddened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you always in the country?\" he inquired. \"I should think it must be\n",
      "dull in the winter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not dull if one has work to do; besides, one's not dull by\n",
      "oneself,\" Levin replied abruptly.\n",

      "always,\" said Countess Nordston.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a queer\n",
      "feeling once,\" he went on. \"I never longed so for the country, Russian\n",
      "country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter\n",
      "with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough, you know. And\n",
      "indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time. And it's\n",
      "just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the\n",
      "country. It's as though...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene,\n",

      "into his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped\n",

      "\n",
      "Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation;\n",

      "though waiting for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess\n",

      "\"Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity's sake do take me to\n",

      "\"My opinion,\" answered Levin, \"is only that this table-turning simply\n",

      "They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while we...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, then you don't believe in it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't believe in it, countess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if I've seen it myself?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you think I tell a lie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she laughed a mirthless laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in\n",
      "it,\" said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still more\n",
      "exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright frank\n",
      "smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening\n",
      "to become disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do not admit the conceivability at all?\" he queried. \"But why not?\n",
      "We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing. Why\n",
      "should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When electricity was discovered,\" Levin interrupted hurriedly, \"it was\n",
      "only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what it\n",
      "proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its\n",
      "applications were conceived. But the spiritualists have begun with\n",
      "tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only\n",
      "later started saying that it is an unknown force.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen,\n",
      "obviously interested in his words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but the spiritualists say we don't know at present what this force\n",
      "is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts.\n",
      "Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in. No, I don't\n",
      "see why there should not be a new force, if it...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, because with electricity,\" Levin interrupted again, \"every time\n",
      "you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in\n",
      "this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a\n",
      "natural phenomenon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for\n",
      "a drawing room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to\n",
      "change the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do let us try at once, countess,\" he said; but Levin would finish\n",
      "saying what he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think,\" he went on, \"that this attempt of the spiritualists to\n",
      "explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.\n",

      "material experiment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I think you would be a first-rate medium,\" said Countess Nordston;\n",
      "\"there's something enthusiastic in you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do let us try table-turning at once, please,\" said Vronsky. \"Princess,\n",
      "will you allow it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin's.\n",
      "She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying\n",
      "him for suffering of which she was herself the cause. \"If you can\n",
      "forgive me, forgive me,\" said her eyes, \"I am so happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate them all, and you, and myself,\" his eyes responded, and he took\n",
      "up his hat. But he was not destined to escape. Just as they were\n",
      "arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of\n",
      "retiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies,\n",
      "addressed Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he began joyously. \"Been here long, my boy? I didn't even know you\n",
      "were in town. Very glad to see you.\" The old prince embraced Levin, and\n",
      "talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely\n",
      "waiting till the prince should turn to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty felt how distasteful her father's warmth was to Levin after what\n",
      "had happened. She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to\n",
      "Vronsky's bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her\n",
      "father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone\n",
      "could be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,\" said Countess Nordston;\n",
      "\"we want to try an experiment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What experiment? Table-turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies and\n",
      "gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,\" said\n",
      "the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his\n",
      "suggestion. \"There's some sense in that, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and,\n",
      "with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of\n",
      "the great ball that was to come off next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope you will be there?\" he said to Kitty. As soon as the old prince\n",
      "turned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression\n",
      "he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of\n",
      "Kitty answering Vronsky's inquiry about the ball.\n",

      "\n",
      "At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with\n",
      "Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was glad at\n",
      "the thought that she had received an _offer_. She had no doubt that she\n",
      "had acted rightly. But after she had gone to bed, for a long while she\n",
      "could not sleep. One impression pursued her relentlessly. It was Levin's\n",
      "face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking out in dark\n",
      "dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father, and glancing\n",
      "at her and at Vronsky. And she felt so sorry for him that tears came\n",
      "into her eyes. But immediately she thought of the man for whom she had\n",
      "given him up. She vividly recalled his manly, resolute face, his noble\n",
      "self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards\n",
      "everyone. She remembered the love for her of the man she loved, and once\n",
      "more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on the pillow, smiling\n",
      "with happiness. \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry; but what could I do? It's not my\n",
      "fault,\" she said to herself; but an inner voice told her something else.\n",
      "Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin's love, or at having\n",
      "refused him, she did not know. But her happiness was poisoned by doubts.\n",
      "\"Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us!\"\n",
      "she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince's little library, one of\n",
      "the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their\n",
      "favorite daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? I'll tell you what!\" shouted the prince, waving his arms, and at\n",
      "once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again. \"That\n",
      "you've no pride, no dignity; that you're disgracing, ruining your\n",
      "daughter by this vulgar, stupid match-making!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, really, for mercy's sake, prince, what have I done?\" said the\n",
      "princess, almost crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had\n",
      "gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no\n",
      "intention of telling him of Levin's offer and Kitty's refusal, still she\n",
      "hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled\n",
      "with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother\n",
      "arrived. And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at once flown\n",
      "into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What have you done? I'll tell you what. First of all, you're trying to\n",
      "catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and\n",
      "with good reason. If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don't\n",
      "pick out the possible suitors. Invite all the young bucks. Engage a\n",
      "piano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays,\n",
      "hunting up good matches. It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you've\n",
      "gone on till you've turned the poor wench's head. Levin's a thousand\n",
      "times the better man. As for this little Petersburg swell, they're\n",
      "turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.\n",
      "But if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after\n",
      "anyone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what have I done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you've...\" The prince was crying wrathfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know if one were to listen to you,\" interrupted the princess, \"we\n",
      "should never marry our daughter. If it's to be so, we'd better go into\n",
      "the country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and we had better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do wait a minute. Do I try and catch them? I don't try to catch\n",
      "them in the least. A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love\n",
      "with her, and she, I fancy...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you fancy! And how if she really is in love, and he's no more\n",
      "thinking of marriage than I am!... Oh, that I should live to see it! Ah!\n",
      "spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!\" And the prince, imagining that he\n",
      "was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word. \"And this\n",
      "is how we're preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she's really got the\n",
      "notion into her head...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what makes you suppose so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things, though\n",
      "women-folk haven't. I see a man who has serious intentions, that's\n",
      "Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who's only amusing\n",
      "himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...\"\n",

      "\"Well, you'll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, well, we won't talk of it,\" the princess stopped him,\n",
      "recollecting her unlucky Dolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By all means, and good night!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with\n",
      "a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had\n",
      "settled Kitty's future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky's\n",
      "intentions, but her husband's words had disturbed her. And returning to\n",
      "her own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like Kitty,\n",
      "repeated several times in her heart, \"Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity;\n",
      "Lord, have pity.\"\n",

      "Vronsky had never had a real home life. His mother had been in her youth\n",
      "a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and\n",
      "still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole\n",
      "fashionable world. His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been\n",
      "educated in the Corps of Pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got\n",
      "into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men. Although he did go more\n",
      "or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto\n",
      "been outside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse\n",
      "life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent\n",
      "girl of his own rank, who cared for him. It never even entered his head\n",
      "that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty. At balls he\n",
      "danced principally with her. He was a constant visitor at their house.\n",
      "He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society--all sorts of\n",
      "nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special\n",
      "meaning in her case. Although he said nothing to her that he could not\n",
      "have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more\n",
      "dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it,\n",
      "and the tenderer was his feeling for her. He did not know that his mode\n",
      "of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is\n",
      "courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such\n",
      "courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men\n",
      "such as he was. It seemed to him that he was the first who had\n",
      "discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he\n",
      "could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard\n",
      "that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been\n",
      "greatly astonished, and would not have believed it. He could not believe\n",
      "that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to\n",
      "her, could be wrong. Still less could he have believed that he ought to\n",
      "marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility. He not only\n",
      "disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in\n",
      "accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he\n",
      "lived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all,\n",
      "ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were\n",
      "saying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys' that the secret\n",
      "spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much\n",
      "stronger that evening that some step must be taken. But what step could\n",
      "and ought to be taken he could not imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is so exquisite,\" he thought, as he returned from the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys', carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious\n",
      "feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he\n",
      "had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of\n",
      "tenderness at her love for him--\"what is so exquisite is that not a word\n",
      "has been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in\n",
      "this unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly\n",
      "than ever she told me she loves me. And how secretly, simply, and most\n",
      "of all, how trustfully! I feel myself better, purer. I feel that I have\n",
      "a heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me. Those sweet,\n",
      "loving eyes! When she said: 'Indeed I do...'\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It's good for me, and good for her.\" And\n",
      "he began wondering where to finish the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed in review of the places he might go to. \"Club? a game of\n",
      "bezique, champagne with Ignatov? No, I'm not going. _Chateau des\n",

      "it. That's why I like the Shtcherbatskys', that I'm growing better. I'll\n",
      "go home.\" He went straight to his room at Dussot's Hotel, ordered\n",

      "\"there's something uncompromising. They are all on the defensive, lose\n",
      "their tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's true, it is so,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing\n",
      "good-humoredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will the train soon be in?\" Vronsky asked a railway official.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The train's signaled,\" answered the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory\n",
      "bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen\n",
      "and attendants, and people meeting the train. Through the frosty vapor\n",
      "could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing\n",
      "the rails of the curving line. The hiss of the boiler could be heard on\n",
      "the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell\n",
      "Vronsky of Levin's intentions in regard to Kitty. \"No, you've not got a\n",
      "true impression of Levin. He's a very nervous man, and is sometimes out\n",
      "of humor, it's true, but then he is often very nice. He's such a true,\n",
      "honest nature, and a heart of gold. But yesterday there were special\n",
      "reasons,\" pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally\n",
      "oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his\n",
      "friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky. \"Yes, there\n",
      "were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or\n",
      "particularly unhappy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky stood still and asked directly: \"How so? Do you mean he made\n",
      "your _belle-soeur_ an offer yesterday?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"I fancied something of the sort\n",
      "yesterday. Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it must\n",
      "mean it.... He's been so long in love, and I'm very sorry for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that's it! I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better\n",
      "match,\" said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again,\n",
      "\"though I don't know him, of course,\" he added. \"Yes, that is a hateful\n",
      "position! That's why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras. If\n",
      "you don't succeed with them it only proves that you've not enough cash,\n",
      "but in this case one's dignity's at stake. But here's the train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The engine had already whistled in the distance. A few instants later\n",
      "the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the\n",
      "air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle\n",
      "wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the\n",
      "engine-driver covered with frost. Behind the tender, setting the\n",
      "platform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog\n",
      "whining in it. At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating\n",
      "before coming to a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the\n",
      "impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards,\n",
      "holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little\n",
      "merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the\n",
      "passengers, totally oblivious of his mother. What he had just heard\n",
      "about Kitty excited and delighted him. Unconsciously he arched his\n",
      "chest, and his eyes flashed. He felt himself a conqueror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,\" said the smart guard, going\n",
      "up to Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guard's words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and\n",
      "his approaching meeting with her. He did not in his heart respect his\n",
      "mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her,\n",
      "though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and\n",
      "with his own education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to\n",
      "his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the\n",
      "more externally obedient and respectful his behavior, the less in his\n",
      "heart he respected and loved her.\n",

      "out.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady's\n",
      "appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society. He\n",
      "begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must\n",
      "glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on account\n",
      "of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole\n",
      "figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she\n",
      "passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.\n",
      "As he looked round, she too turned her head. Her shining gray eyes, that\n",
      "looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his\n",
      "face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away\n",
      "to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone. In that brief look\n",
      "Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over\n",
      "her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile\n",
      "that curved her red lips. It was as though her nature were so brimming\n",
      "over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the\n",
      "flash of her eyes, and now in her smile. Deliberately she shrouded the\n",
      "light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in the faintly\n",
      "perceptible smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky stepped into the carriage. His mother, a dried-up old lady with\n",
      "black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and\n",
      "smiled slightly with her thin lips. Getting up from the seat and handing\n",
      "her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss,\n",
      "and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had a good journey?\" said her son, sitting down beside her, and\n",
      "involuntarily listening to a woman's voice outside the door. He knew it\n",
      "was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the same I don't agree with you,\" said the lady's voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the Petersburg view, madame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,\" she responded.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch. And could you see if my brother is here, and\n",

      "into the compartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, have you found your brother?\" said Countess Vronskaya, addressing\n",
      "the lady.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your brother is here,\" he said, standing up. \"Excuse me, I did not know\n",
      "you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,\" said Vronsky, bowing,\n",
      "\"that no doubt you do not remember me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said she, \"I should have known you because your mother and I\n",
      "have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.\" As she\n",
      "spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself\n",
      "in her smile. \"And still no sign of my brother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do call him, Alexey,\" said the old countess. Vronsky stepped out onto\n",

      "\n",
      "Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching\n",

      "as her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by\n",
      "its decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew\n",
      "him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly. Vronsky gazed, never taking\n",
      "his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why. But\n",
      "recollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again\n",
      "into the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's very sweet, isn't she?\" said the countess of Madame Karenina.\n",
      "\"Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. We've\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what you are referring to, maman,\" he answered coldly.\n",
      "\"Come, maman, let us go.\"\n",

      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said the countess, taking her hand. \"I could go all around the\n",

      "in whose company it's sweet to be silent as well as to talk. Now please\n",
      "don't fret over your son; you can't expect never to be parted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her\n",
      "eyes were smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anna Arkadyevna,\" the countess said in explanation to her son, \"has a\n",
      "little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted\n",
      "from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and\n",
      "she of hers,\" said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her\n",
      "face, a caressing smile intended for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,\" he said,\n",
      "promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him. But apparently\n",
      "she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she\n",
      "turned to the old countess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye, countess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye, my love,\" answered the countess. \"Let me have a kiss of your\n",

      "lost my heart to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and\n",
      "was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek\n",
      "to the countess's lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile\n",
      "fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky.\n",
      "He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as though at\n",
      "something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and\n",
      "vigorously shook his hand. She went out with the rapid step which bore\n",
      "her rather fully-developed figure with such strange lightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very charming,\" said the countess.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was just what her son was thinking. His eyes followed her till her\n",
      "graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his\n",
      "face. He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her\n",
      "arm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously something\n",
      "that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, maman, are you perfectly well?\" he repeated, turning to his\n",
      "mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good, and Marie\n",
      "has grown very pretty. She's very interesting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she began telling him again of what interested her most--the\n",
      "christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in\n",
      "Petersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Lavrenty,\" said Vronsky, looking out of the window; \"now we can\n",
      "go, if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old butler who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage\n",
      "to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come; there's not such a crowd now,\" said Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the\n",
      "other baggage. Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were\n",
      "getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with\n",
      "panic-stricken faces. The station-master, too, ran by in his\n",
      "extraordinary colored cap. Obviously something unusual had happened. The\n",
      "crowd who had left the train were running back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...\" was heard\n",
      "among the crowd. Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm, turned\n",
      "back. They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid\n",
      "the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the\n",
      "crowd to find out details of the disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had\n",
      "not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from\n",
      "the butler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse. Oblonsky was\n",
      "evidently upset. He frowned and seemed ready to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!\" he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if you had seen it, countess,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"And his\n",

      "body. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How awful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't one do anything for her?\" said Madame Karenina in an agitated\n",
      "whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be back directly, maman,\" he remarked, turning round in the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now let us be off,\" said Vronsky, coming in. They went out together.\n",
      "Vronsky was in front with his mother. Behind walked Madame Karenina with\n",
      "her brother. Just as they were going out of the station the\n",
      "station-master overtook Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain for\n",
      "whose benefit you intend them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the widow,\" said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders. \"I should have\n",
      "thought there was no need to ask.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You gave that?\" cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his sister's\n",

      "Good-bye, countess.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"On the contrary, I think it's the easiest--instantaneous,\" observed\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it they don't take proper precautions?\" said a third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch\n",
      "saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with\n",
      "difficulty restraining her tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, Anna?\" he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's an omen of evil,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What nonsense!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"You've come, that's the\n",
      "chief thing. You can't conceive how I'm resting my hopes on you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you known Vronsky long?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. You know we're hoping he will marry Kitty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes?\" said Anna softly. \"Come now, let us talk of you,\" she added,\n",
      "tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something\n",
      "superfluous oppressing her. \"Let us talk of your affairs. I got your\n",
      "letter, and here I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, all my hopes are in you,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, tell me all about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.\n",

      "When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little\n",
      "drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his\n",
      "father, giving him a lesson in French reading. As the boy read, he kept\n",
      "twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.\n",
      "His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the fat little\n",
      "hand went back to the button again. His mother pulled the button off and\n",
      "put it in her pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep your hands still, Grisha,\" she said, and she took up her work, a\n",
      "coverlet she had long been making. She always set to work on it at\n",
      "depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her\n",
      "fingers and counting the stitches. Though she had sent word the day\n",
      "before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came\n",
      "or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting\n",
      "her sister-in-law with emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it. Still she\n",
      "did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the\n",
      "most important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg _grande\n",
      "dame_. And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her\n",
      "threat to her husband--that is to say, she remembered that her\n",
      "sister-in-law was coming. \"And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame,\"\n",
      "thought Dolly. \"I know nothing of her except the very best, and I have\n",
      "seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself.\" It was\n",
      "true that as far as she could recall her impressions at Petersburg at\n",
      "the Karenins', she did not like their household itself; there was\n",
      "something artificial in the whole framework of their family life. \"But\n",
      "why should I not receive her? If only she doesn't take it into her head\n",

      "\n",
      "All these days Dolly had been alone with her children. She did not want\n",
      "to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not\n",
      "talk of outside matters. She knew that in one way or another she would\n",
      "tell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of\n",
      "speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her\n",
      "humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases\n",
      "of good advice and comfort. She had been on the lookout for her,\n",
      "glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip\n",

      "\n",
      "Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked\n",

      "\"Dolly, how glad I am to see you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am glad, too,\" said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the\n",
      "expression of Anna's face to find out whether she knew. \"Most likely she\n",
      "knows,\" she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna's face. \"Well, come\n",
      "along, I'll take you to your room,\" she went on, trying to defer as long\n",
      "as possible the moment of confidences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he's grown!\" said Anna; and kissing him,\n",
      "never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a little.\n",
      "\"No, please, let us stay here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her\n",
      "black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her\n",
      "hair down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are radiant with health and happiness!\" said Dolly, almost with\n",
      "envy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I?.... Yes,\" said Anna. \"Merciful heavens, Tanya! You're the same age\n",
      "as my Seryozha,\" she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.\n",
      "She took her in her arms and kissed her. \"Delightful child, delightful!\n",
      "Show me them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years,\n",
      "months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not\n",
      "but appreciate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, we will go to them,\" she said. \"It's a pity Vassya's\n",
      "asleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing\n",
      "room, to coffee. Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dolly,\" she said, \"he has told me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of\n",
      "conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dolly, dear,\" she said, \"I don't want to speak for him to you, nor to\n",
      "try to comfort you; that's impossible. But, darling, I'm simply sorry,\n",
      "sorry from my heart for you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered. She\n",
      "moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous\n",
      "little hand. Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its\n",
      "frigid expression. She said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To comfort me's impossible. Everything's lost after what has happened,\n",
      "everything's over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened. Anna lifted\n",
      "the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, Dolly, what's to be done, what's to be done? How is it best to act\n",
      "in this awful position--that's what you must think of.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All's over, and there's nothing more,\" said Dolly. \"And the worst of\n",
      "all is, you see, that I can't cast him off: there are the children, I am\n",
      "tied. And I can't live with him! it's a torture to me to see him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you:\n",
      "tell me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly looked at her inquiringly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" she said all at once. \"But I will tell you it from the\n",
      "beginning. You know how I was married. With the education mamma gave us\n",
      "I was more than innocent, I was stupid. I knew nothing. I know they say\n",
      "men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva\"--she corrected\n",
      "herself--\"Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing. You'll hardly believe it,\n",
      "but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So I\n",
      "lived eight years. You must understand that I was so far from suspecting\n",
      "infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then--try to imagine\n",
      "it--with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the\n",
      "loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me. To be fully convinced\n",
      "of one's happiness, and all at once...\" continued Dolly, holding back\n",
      "her sobs, \"to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress, my governess.\n",
      "No, it's too awful!\" She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her\n",
      "face in it. \"I can understand being carried away by feeling,\" she went\n",
      "on after a brief silence, \"but deliberately, slyly deceiving me ... and\n",
      "with whom?... To go on being my husband together with her ... it's\n",
      "awful! You can't understand...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do understand,\"\n",
      "said Anna, pressing her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?\" Dolly\n",
      "resumed. \"Not the slightest! He's happy and contented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" Anna interposed quickly. \"He's to be pitied, he's weighed down\n",
      "by remorse...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he capable of remorse?\" Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her\n",
      "sister-in-law's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him.\n",
      "We both know him. He's good-hearted, but he's proud, and now he's so\n",
      "humiliated. What touched me most...\" (and here Anna guessed what would\n",
      "touch Dolly most) \"he's tortured by two things: that he's ashamed for\n",
      "the children's sake, and that, loving you--yes, yes, loving you beyond\n",
      "everything on earth,\" she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would have\n",
      "answered--\"he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart. 'No, no, she\n",
      "cannot forgive me,' he keeps saying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to\n",
      "her words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it's worse for the guilty\n",
      "than the innocent,\" she said, \"if he feels that all the misery comes\n",
      "from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife\n",
      "again after her? For me to live with him now would be torture, just\n",
      "because I love my past love for him...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And sobs cut short her words. But as though of set design, each time she\n",
      "was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's young, you see, she's pretty,\" she went on. \"Do you know, Anna,\n",
      "my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and his children.\n",
      "I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service, and now of\n",
      "course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him. No doubt they\n",
      "talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent. Do you\n",
      "understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again her eyes glowed with hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him? Never! No,\n",
      "everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of\n",
      "my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching\n",
      "Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. What\n",
      "have I to strive and toil for? Why are the children here? What's so\n",
      "awful is that all at once my heart's turned, and instead of love and\n",
      "tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could kill\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Darling Dolly, I understand, but don't torture yourself. You are so\n",
      "distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought over\n",
      "everything, and I see nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each\n",
      "word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thing I would say,\" began Anna. \"I am his sister, I know his\n",
      "character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything\" (she waved\n",
      "her hand before her forehead), \"that faculty for being completely\n",
      "carried away, but for completely repenting too. He cannot believe it, he\n",
      "cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; he understands, he understood!\" Dolly broke in. \"But I ... you are\n",
      "forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the\n",
      "awfulness of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the family\n",
      "was broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it,\n",
      "as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can't tell you\n",
      "how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your\n",
      "sufferings, only there is one thing I don't know; I don't know ... I\n",
      "don't know how much love there is still in your heart for him. That you\n",
      "know--whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. If\n",
      "there is, forgive him!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand once\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know more of the world than you do,\" she said. \"I know how men like\n",
      "Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with her. That never\n",
      "happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to\n",
      "them. Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by\n",
      "them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. They draw a\n",
      "sort of line that can't be crossed between them and their families. I\n",
      "don't understand it, but it is so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but he has kissed her...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I\n",
      "remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all\n",
      "the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the\n",
      "longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You\n",
      "know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:\n",
      "'Dolly's a marvelous woman.' You have always been a divinity for him,\n",
      "and you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the\n",
      "heart...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if it is repeated?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It cannot be, as I understand it...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but could you forgive it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, I can't judge.... Yes, I can,\" said Anna, thinking a\n",
      "moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her\n",
      "inner balance, she added: \"Yes, I can, I can, I can. Yes, I could\n",
      "forgive it. I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and\n",
      "forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, of course,\" Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she had\n",
      "more than once thought, \"else it would not be forgiveness. If one\n",
      "forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let us go; I'll take\n",
      "you to your room,\" she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced\n",
      "Anna. \"My dear, how glad I am you came. It has made things better, ever\n",

      "The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that's to say at the\n",
      "Oblonskys', and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had\n",
      "already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. Anna spent\n",
      "the whole morning with Dolly and the children. She merely sent a brief\n",
      "note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.\n",
      "\"Come, God is merciful,\" she wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,\n",

      "In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still\n",

      "Immediately after dinner Kitty came in. She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but\n",
      "only very slightly, and she came now to her sister's with some\n",
      "trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg\n",
      "lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of. But she made a favorable\n",
      "impression on Anna Arkadyevna--she saw that at once. Anna was\n",
      "unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew\n",
      "where she was she found herself not merely under Anna's sway, but in\n",
      "love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married\n",
      "women. Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of\n",
      "eight years old. In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and\n",
      "the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in\n",
      "her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of\n",
      "twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her\n",
      "eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty. Kitty felt that Anna was\n",
      "perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another\n",
      "higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly\n",
      "and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa\n",
      "where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. Either because\n",
      "the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they\n",
      "felt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the\n",
      "younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about\n",
      "their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side. And it\n",
      "had become a sort of game among them to sit a close as possible to their\n",
      "aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring,\n",
      "or even touch the flounce of her skirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, as we were sitting before,\" said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting\n",
      "down in her place.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?\" Anna said, with\n",
      "tender irony.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's strange, but there are. At the Bobrishtchevs' one always enjoys\n",
      "oneself, and at the Nikitins' too, while at the Mezhkovs' it's always\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,\"\n",
      "said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which\n",
      "was not open to her. \"For me there are some less dull and tiresome.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can _you_ be dull at a ball?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?\" inquired Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because you always look nicer than anyone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna had the faculty of blushing. She blushed a little, and said:\n",

      "\"In the first place it's never so; and secondly, if it were, what\n",
      "difference would it make to me?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "without that,\" she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I imagine you at the ball in lilac.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why in lilac precisely?\" asked Anna, smiling. \"Now, children, run\n",
      "along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,\" she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh! what a happy time you are at,\" pursued Anna. \"I remember, and I\n",
      "know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland. That\n",
      "mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is\n",
      "just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path\n",
      "growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to\n",
      "enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not been\n",
      "through it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty smiled without speaking. \"But how did she go through it? How I\n",
      "should like to know all her love story!\" thought Kitty, recalling the\n",
      "unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked him so\n",
      "much,\" Anna continued. \"I met Vronsky at the railway station.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, was he there?\" asked Kitty, blushing. \"What was it Stiva told you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled\n",
      "yesterday with Vronsky's mother,\" she went on; \"and his mother talked\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What did his mother tell you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, a great deal! And I know that he's her favorite; still one can see\n",
      "how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had\n",
      "wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done\n",
      "something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of\n",
      "the water. He's a hero, in fact,\" said Anna, smiling and recollecting\n",
      "the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles. For some\n",
      "reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. She felt that there\n",

      "not to have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She pressed me very much to go and see her,\" Anna went on; \"and I shall\n",

      "\"Oh, please, don't trouble about me,\" answered Anna, looking intently\n",

      "reconciliation or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be lighter for you here,\" answered her sister-in-law.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. No one\n",

      "him.\n",

      "\"God knows whether they are fully reconciled,\" thought Anna, hearing her\n",
      "tone, cold and composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,\" answered her husband.\n",
      "\"Come, I'll do it all, if you like...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, they must be reconciled,\" thought Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know how you do everything,\" answered Dolly. \"You tell Matvey to do\n",
      "what can't be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle\n",
      "of everything,\" and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of\n",
      "Dolly's lips as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Full, full reconciliation, full,\" thought Anna; \"thank God!\" and\n",
      "rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly and kissed\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?\" said Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to\n",
      "her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not\n",
      "so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his\n",
      "offense.\n",

      "At half-past nine o'clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family\n",
      "conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys' was broken up by an\n",
      "apparently simple incident. But this simple incident for some reason\n",
      "struck everyone as strange. Talking about common acquaintances in\n",
      "Petersburg, Anna got up quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is in my album,\" she said; \"and, by the way, I'll show you my\n",

      "\n",
      "Towards ten o'clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and\n",
      "often before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed\n",
      "at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept\n",
      "coming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha. She longed to look\n",
      "at his photograph and talk of him. Seizing the first pretext, she got\n",
      "up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album. The stairs up\n",
      "to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as she was leaving the drawing room, a ring was heard in the hall.\n",

      "\"Who can that be?\" said Dolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it's late,\"\n",
      "observed Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure to be someone with papers for me,\" put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up\n",
      "to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a\n",
      "lamp. Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange\n",
      "feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred\n",
      "in her heart. He was standing still, not taking off his coat, pulling\n",
      "something out of his pocket. At the instant when she was just facing the\n",
      "stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and into the expression\n",
      "of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay. With a\n",
      "slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing behind her Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch's loud voice calling him to come up, and the quiet, soft,\n",
      "and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the\n",
      "dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.\n",
      "\"And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he is!\"\n",
      "added Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty blushed. She thought that she was the only person who knew why he\n",
      "had come, and why he would not come up. \"He has been at home,\" she\n",
      "thought, \"and didn't find me, and thought I should be here, but he did\n",

      "The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the\n",
      "great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen\n",
      "in powder and red coats. From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as\n",
      "from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing\n",
      "between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before\n",

      "the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz. A little old man\n",
      "in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and\n",
      "diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and\n",
      "stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know. A beardless\n",
      "youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky\n",
      "called \"young bucks,\" in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening\n",
      "his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back\n",
      "to ask Kitty for a quadrille. As the first quadrille had already been\n",
      "given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second. An officer,\n",
      "buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his\n",
      "mustache, admired rosy Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball\n",
      "had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she\n",
      "walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip\n",
      "as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute\n",
      "details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment's\n",
      "attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her\n",
      "hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of\n",

      "\n",
      "When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried\n",
      "to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a\n",
      "little. She felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful,\n",
      "and nothing could need setting straight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of Kitty's best days. Her dress was not uncomfortable\n",
      "anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not\n",
      "crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels\n",
      "did not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair\n",
      "chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair. All the three\n",
      "buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her\n",
      "hand without concealing its lines. The black velvet of her locket\n",
      "nestled with special softness round her neck. That velvet was delicious;\n",
      "at home, looking at her neck in the looking glass, Kitty had felt that\n",
      "that velvet was speaking. About all the rest there might be a doubt, but\n",
      "the velvet was delicious. Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she\n",
      "glanced at it in the glass. Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a\n",
      "sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked. Her eyes\n",
      "sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the\n",
      "consciousness of her own attractiveness. She had scarcely entered the\n",
      "ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and\n",
      "flowers, waiting to be asked to dance--Kitty was never one of that\n",
      "throng--when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner,\n",
      "the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of\n",
      "dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky. He\n",
      "had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had danced the\n",
      "first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom--that is to say, a\n",
      "few couples who had started dancing--he caught sight of Kitty, entering,\n",
      "and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to\n",
      "directors of balls. Without even asking her if she cared to dance, he\n",
      "put out his arm to encircle her slender waist. She looked round for\n",
      "someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How nice you've come in good time,\" he said to her, embracing her\n",
      "waist; \"such a bad habit to be late.\" Bending her left hand, she laid it\n",
      "on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began\n",
      "swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in\n",
      "time to the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a rest to waltz with you,\" he said to her, as they fell into the\n",
      "first slow steps of the waltz. \"It's exquisite--such lightness,\n",
      "precision.\" He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his\n",
      "partners whom he knew well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his\n",
      "shoulder. She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces\n",
      "in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland. And she was not a\n",
      "girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the\n",
      "ballroom was familiar and tiresome. But she was in the middle stage\n",
      "between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had\n",
      "sufficient self-possession to be able to observe. In the left corner of\n",
      "the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.\n",
      "There--incredibly naked--was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky's wife; there\n",
      "was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always\n",
      "to be found where the best people were. In that direction gazed the\n",
      "young men, not venturing to approach. There, too, she descried Stiva,\n",
      "and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black\n",
      "velvet gown. And _he_ was there. Kitty had not seen him since the\n",
      "evening she refused Levin. With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at\n",
      "once, and was even aware that he was looking at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another turn, eh? You're not tired?\" said Korsunsky, a little out of\n",
      "breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where shall I take you?\"\n",

      "\"Madame Karenina's here, I think ... take me to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wherever you command.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the\n",
      "group in the left corner, continually saying, \"Pardon, mesdames, pardon,\n",
      "pardon, mesdames\"; and steering his course through the sea of lace,\n",
      "tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner\n",
      "sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings,\n",
      "were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape and covered\n",
      "Krivin's knees. Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and\n",
      "gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna. Kitty, flushed, took\n",
      "her train from Krivin's knees, and, a little giddy, looked round,\n",
      "seeking Anna. Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished,\n",
      "but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full throat and\n",
      "shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her rounded\n",
      "arms, with tiny, slender wrists. The whole gown was trimmed with\n",
      "Venetian guipure. On her head, among her black hair--her own, with no\n",
      "false additions--was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the\n",
      "same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace. Her coiffure was\n",
      "not striking. All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of\n",
      "her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples.\n",
      "Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured\n",
      "her invariably in lilac. But now seeing her in black, she felt that she\n",
      "had not fully seen her charm. She saw her now as someone quite new and\n",
      "surprising to her. Now she understood that Anna could not have been in\n",
      "lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her\n",
      "attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her. And her black\n",
      "dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only\n",
      "the frame, and all that was seen was she--simple, natural, elegant, and\n",
      "at the same time gay and eager.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty\n",
      "drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her\n",
      "head slightly turned towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't throw stones,\" she was saying, in answer to something,\n",
      "\"though I can't understand it,\" she went on, shrugging her shoulders,\n",
      "and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.\n",
      "With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a\n",
      "movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty,\n",
      "signifying approval of her dress and her looks. \"You came into the room\n",
      "dancing,\" she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is one of my most faithful supporters,\" said Korsunsky, bowing to\n",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen. \"The princess helps to make\n",
      "balls happy and successful. Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?\" he said, bending\n",
      "down to her.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't dance when it's possible not to dance,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But tonight it's impossible,\" answered Korsunsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant Vronsky came up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, since it's impossible tonight, let us start,\" she said, not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is she vexed with him about?\" thought Kitty, discerning that Anna\n",
      "had intentionally not responded to Vronsky's bow. Vronsky went up to\n",
      "Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret\n",
      "that he had not seen her all this time. Kitty gazed in admiration at\n",
      "Anna waltzing, and listened to him. She expected him to ask her for a\n",
      "waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him. He flushed\n",
      "slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put his\n",
      "arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly\n",
      "stopped. Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her own, and\n",
      "long afterwards--for several years after--that look, full of love, to\n",
      "which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Pardon! pardon!_ Waltz! waltz!\" shouted Korsunsky from the other side\n",

      "She had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the evening, and\n",

      "the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself; she\n",
      "saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was\n",
      "exciting. She knew that feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in\n",

      "liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into the\n",
      "_grand rond_, and then into the _chaine_, and at the same time she kept\n",
      "watch with a growing pang at her heart. \"No, it's not the admiration of\n",

      "can it be he?\" Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into\n",
      "her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips. she seemed to\n",

      "delight, but they came out on her face of themselves. \"But what of him?\"\n",
      "Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror. What was pictured so\n",
      "clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna's face she saw in him. What had\n",
      "become of his always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly\n",
      "serene expression of his face? Now every time he turned to her, he bent\n",
      "his head, as though he would have fallen at her feet, and in his eyes\n",
      "there was nothing but humble submission and dread. \"I would not offend\n",
      "you,\" his eyes seemed every time to be saying, \"but I want to save\n",
      "myself, and I don't know how.\" On his face was a look such as Kitty had\n",
      "never seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial\n",
      "conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was\n",
      "determining their fate and hers. And strange it was that they were\n",
      "actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and\n",
      "how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had\n",
      "all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as Kitty\n",
      "did. The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in\n",

      "\n",
      "Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the\n",

      "talk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the\n",

      "long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the\n",
      "figures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that\n",
      "her unhappiness was complete. She saw that they felt themselves alone in\n",
      "that crowded room. And on Vronsky's face, always so firm and\n",
      "independent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and\n",

      "\n",
      "Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him. She grew thoughtful,\n",
      "and he became serious. Some supernatural force drew Kitty's eyes to\n",
      "Anna's face. She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating\n",
      "were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck\n",
      "with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose\n",
      "hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and\n",

      "something terrible and cruel in her fascination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her\n",
      "suffering. Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it. When Vronsky\n",

      "her, she was so changed.\n",
      "\n",

      "in dismay as she went up. Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and\n",
      "smiled, pressing her hand. But, noticing that Kitty only responded to\n",
      "her smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her,\n",
      "and began gaily talking to the other lady.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I\n",

      "\"Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,\" thought Levin, as he\n",
      "came away from the Shtcherbatskys', and walked in the direction of his\n",
      "brother's lodgings. \"And I don't get on with other people. Pride, they\n",
      "say. No, I have no pride. If I had any pride, I should not have put\n",
      "myself in such a position.\" And he pictured to himself Vronsky, happy,\n",
      "good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed in the\n",
      "awful position in which he had been that evening. \"Yes, she was bound to\n",
      "choose him. So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or\n",
      "anything. I am myself to blame. What right had I to imagine she would\n",
      "care to join her life to mine? Who am I and what am I? A nobody, not\n",
      "wanted by any one, nor of use to anybody.\" And he recalled his brother\n",
      "Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him. \"Isn't he right\n",
      "that everything in the world is base and loathsome? And are we fair in\n",
      "our judgment of brother Nikolay? Of course, from the point of view of\n",

      "But I know him differently. I know his soul, and know that we are like\n",
      "him. And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to dinner, and\n",
      "came here.\" Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his brother's address,\n",
      "which was in his pocketbook, and called a sledge. All the long way to\n",
      "his brother's, Levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of\n",
      "his brother Nikolay's life. He remembered how his brother, while at the\n",
      "university, and for a year afterwards, had, in spite of the jeers of his\n",
      "companions, lived like a monk, strictly observing all religious rites,\n",
      "services, and fasts, and avoiding every sort of pleasure, especially\n",
      "women. And afterwards, how he had all at once broken out: he had\n",
      "associated with the most horrible people, and rushed into the most\n",
      "senseless debauchery. He remembered later the scandal over a boy, whom\n",
      "he had taken from the country to bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so\n",
      "violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for\n",
      "unlawfully wounding. Then he recalled the scandal with a sharper, to\n",
      "whom he had lost money, and given a promissory note, and against whom he\n",
      "had himself lodged a complaint, asserting that he had cheated him. (This\n",
      "was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.) Then he remembered how he had\n",
      "spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street. He\n",
      "remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his\n",
      "brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share\n",
      "of his mother's fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a\n",
      "western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble\n",
      "for assaulting a village elder.... It was all horribly disgusting, yet\n",
      "to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it\n",
      "inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his\n",
      "story, did not know his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the\n",
      "period of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in\n",
      "religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone,\n",
      "far from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the\n",
      "others. They had teased him, called him Noah and Monk; and, when he had\n",
      "broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away from him\n",
      "with horror and disgust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother\n",
      "Nikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the\n",
      "wrong than the people who despised him. He was not to blame for having\n",

      "everything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve,\n",
      "too, and I'll show him that I love him, and so understand him,\" Levin\n",

      "heard his cough.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:\n",

      "that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was\n",
      "sitting on the sofa. His brother was not to be seen. Konstantin felt a\n",
      "sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which\n",
      "his brother spent his life. No one had heard him, and Konstantin, taking\n",
      "off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was\n",
      "saying. He was speaking of some enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,\" his brother's voice\n",

      "there's any left; or else go and get some.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whom do you want?\" said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's I,\" answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's _I_?\" Nikolay's voice said again, still more angrily. He could be\n",
      "heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin saw,\n",
      "facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge, thin,\n",
      "stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing in its\n",
      "weirdness and sickliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had\n",
      "seen him last. He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones\n",
      "seemed huger than ever. His hair had grown thinner, the same straight\n",
      "mustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his\n",
      "visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Kostya!\" he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and his\n",
      "eyes lit up with joy. But the same second he looked round at the young\n",
      "man, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin knew\n",
      "so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different expression,\n",
      "wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don't know you and\n",
      "don't want to know you. What is it you want?\"\n",

      "He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him. The\n",
      "worst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations\n",

      "thought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that\n",
      "nervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.\n",

      "His brother's timidity obviously softened Nikolay. His lips twitched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, so that's it?\" he said. \"Well, come in; sit down. Like some supper?\n",
      "Masha, bring supper for three. No, stop a minute. Do you know who this\n",
      "is?\" he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the gentleman in\n",
      "the jerkin: \"This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a very remarkable\n",
      "man. He's persecuted by the police, of course, because he's not a\n",
      "scoundrel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.\n",
      "Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he\n",
      "shouted to her, \"Wait a minute, I said.\" And with the inability to\n",
      "express himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he began,\n",
      "with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother Kritsky's\n",
      "story: how he had been expelled from the university for starting a\n",
      "benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools; and how he had\n",
      "afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he had been\n",
      "driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're of the Kiev university?\" said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to\n",
      "break the awkward silence that followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I was of Kiev,\" Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And this woman,\" Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her, \"is\n",
      "the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna. I took her out of a bad\n",
      "house,\" and he jerked his neck saying this; \"but I love her and respect\n",
      "her, and any one who wants to know me,\" he added, raising his voice and\n",
      "knitting his brows, \"I beg to love her and respect her. She's just the\n",
      "same as my wife, just the same. So now you know whom you've to do with.\n",
      "And if you think you're lowering yourself, well, here's the floor,\n",
      "there's the door.\"\n",

      "\"So you see,\" pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead\n",
      "and twitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, do you see?\"... He pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened\n",
      "together with strings, lying in a corner of the room. \"Do you see that?\n",
      "That's the beginning of a new thing we're going into. It's a productive\n",

      "himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the\n",
      "association. He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him\n",
      "from self-contempt. Nikolay Levin went on talking:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with us, the\n",
      "peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however\n",
      "much they work they can't escape from their position of beasts of\n",
      "burden. All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their\n",
      "position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education, all\n",
      "the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists. And society's\n",
      "so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the profit of the\n",
      "merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of burden to the end.\n",
      "And that state of things must be changed,\" he finished up, and he looked\n",
      "questioningly at his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course,\" said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had\n",
      "come out on his brother's projecting cheek bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so we're founding a locksmiths' association, where all the\n",
      "production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in\n",
      "common.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the association to be?\" asked Konstantin Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work\n",
      "as it is. Why a locksmiths' association in a village?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were,\n",
      "and that's why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don't like people to try and\n",
      "get them out of their slavery,\" said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the\n",
      "objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty\n",

      "smiling.\n",

      "suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch. \"I'll tell you what for....\n",
      "But what's the use of talking? There's only one thing.... What did you\n",
      "come to me for? You look down on this, and you're welcome to,--and go\n",
      "away, in God's name go away!\" he shrieked, getting up from his chair.\n",
      "\"And go away, and go away!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back. Nikolay Levin looked round\n",
      "angrily at her. She went quickly to him, and whispered something.\n",

      "\"I'm not well; I've grown irritable,\" said Nikolay Levin, getting calmer\n",
      "and breathing painfully; \"and then you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch\n",

      "What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it? Have you read\n",
      "his article?\" he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and\n",

      "space.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've not read it,\" Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring\n",

      "\"Why not?\" said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon\n",
      "Kritsky.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time? That\n",
      "article's too deep for many people--that's to say it's over their heads.\n",
      "But with me, it's another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know\n",
      "where its weakness lies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was mute. Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.\n",

      "light. He felt himself, and did not want to be any one else. All he\n",

      "luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow\n",

      "interested in them,--but they had abruptly dropped their play with their\n",

      "going away. Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her\n",

      "state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with\n",
      "herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part\n",

      "tomorrow? It's a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to\n",
      "you,\" said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and\n",

      "a torture to her instead of a pleasure. But truly, truly, it's not my\n",

      "an instant,\" said Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they\n",
      "were not true. She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at\n",

      "\"Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant to be\n",
      "matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. Possibly\n",
      "against my own will...\"\n",

      "he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!\" said Anna, and again a deep\n",

      "seeing that she too had her weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An enemy? That can't be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care\n",

      "Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day,\n",

      "With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took\n",
      "out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet,\n",
      "settled herself comfortably. An invalid lady had already lain down to\n",
      "sleep. Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady\n",
      "tucked up her feet, and made observations about the heating of the\n",
      "train. Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment\n",
      "from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp, hooked it onto\n",
      "the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper knife and an English\n",
      "novel. At first her reading made no progress. The fuss and bustle were\n",
      "disturbing; then when the train had started, she could not help\n",
      "listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and\n",
      "sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by,\n",
      "covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about the terrible\n",
      "snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention. Farther on, it was\n",
      "continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the\n",
      "same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat\n",
      "to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same\n",
      "figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and\n",
      "to understand what she read. Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on\n",
      "her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.\n",
      "Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her to\n",
      "read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people's lives. She had\n",
      "too great a desire to live herself. If she read that the heroine of the\n",
      "novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps\n",
      "about the room of a sick man; if she read of a member of Parliament\n",
      "making a speech, she longed to be delivering the speech; if she read of\n",
      "how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her\n",
      "sister-in-law, and had surprised everyone by her boldness, she too\n",
      "wished to be doing the same. But there was no chance of doing anything;\n",
      "and twisting the smooth paper knife in her little hands, she forced\n",
      "herself to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness,\n",
      "a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him\n",
      "to the estate, when she suddenly felt that _he_ ought to feel ashamed,\n",
      "and that she was ashamed of the same thing. But what had he to be\n",
      "ashamed of? \"What have I to be ashamed of?\" she asked herself in injured\n",
      "surprise. She laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair,\n",
      "tightly gripping the paper cutter in both hands. There was nothing. She\n",
      "went over all her Moscow recollections. All were good, pleasant. She\n",
      "remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish\n",
      "adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was nothing\n",
      "shameful. And for all that, at the same point in her memories, the\n",
      "feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just at\n",
      "the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her, \"Warm, very\n",
      "warm, hot.\" \"Well, what is it?\" she said to herself resolutely, shifting\n",
      "her seat in the lounge. \"What does it mean? Am I afraid to look it\n",
      "straight in the face? Why, what is it? Can it be that between me and\n",
      "this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations than\n",
      "such as are common with every acquaintance?\" She laughed contemptuously\n",
      "and took up her book again; but now she was definitely unable to follow\n",
      "what she read. She passed the paper knife over the window pane, then\n",
      "laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and almost laughed aloud at\n",
      "the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her. She\n",
      "felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and\n",
      "tighter on some sort of screwing peg. She felt her eyes opening wider\n",
      "and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously, something within\n",
      "oppressing her breathing, while all shapes and sounds seemed in the\n",
      "uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed vividness. Moments\n",
      "of doubt were continually coming upon her, when she was uncertain\n",
      "whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or were standing\n",
      "still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or a stranger.\n",
      "\"What's that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast? And\n",
      "what am I myself? Myself or some other woman?\" She was afraid of giving\n",
      "way to this delirium. But something drew her towards it, and she could\n",
      "yield to it or resist it at will. She got up to rouse herself, and\n",
      "slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress. For a moment she\n",
      "regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had\n",
      "come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the\n",
      "stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer, that it was the\n",
      "wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but then everything\n",
      "grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist seemed to be\n",
      "gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her legs\n",
      "the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud;\n",
      "then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone were\n",
      "being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire\n",
      "before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything. Anna\n",
      "felt as though she were sinking down. But it was not terrible, but\n",
      "delightful. The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted\n",
      "something in her ear. She got up and pulled herself together; she\n",
      "realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard.\n",
      "She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl,\n",
      "put them on and moved towards the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you wish to get out?\" asked Annushka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I want a little air. It's very hot in here.\" And she opened the\n",
      "door. The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled\n",
      "with her over the door. But she enjoyed the struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened the door and went out. The wind seemed as though lying in\n",
      "wait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear\n",
      "her off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got\n",
      "down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages. The wind\n",
      "had been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of\n",
      "the carriages, there was a lull. With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of\n",
      "the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about the\n",
      "platform and the lighted station.\n",

      "\n",
      "The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages,\n",
      "about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station. The\n",
      "carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered\n",
      "with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered.\n",
      "For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would\n",
      "swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand\n",
      "against it. Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together,\n",
      "their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and\n",
      "closed the big doors. The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet,\n",
      "and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron. \"Hand over that telegram!\"\n",
      "came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side. \"This\n",
      "way! No. 28!\" several different voices shouted again, and muffled\n",
      "figures ran by covered with snow. Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes\n",
      "passed by her. She drew one more deep breath of the fresh air, and had\n",
      "just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get\n",
      "back into the carriage, when another man in a military overcoat, quite\n",
      "close beside her, stepped between her and the flickering light of the\n",
      "lamp post. She looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky's\n",
      "face. Putting his hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to her and\n",
      "asked, Was there anything she wanted? Could he be of any service to her?\n",
      "She gazed rather a long while at him without answering, and, in spite of\n",
      "the shadow in which he was standing, she saw, or fancied she saw, both\n",
      "the expression of his face and his eyes. It was again that expression of\n",
      "reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before. More\n",
      "than once she had told herself during the past few days, and again only\n",
      "a few moments before, that Vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds\n",
      "of young men, forever exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that\n",
      "she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him. But now at\n",
      "the first instant of meeting him, she was seized by a feeling of joyful\n",
      "pride. She had no need to ask why he had come. She knew as certainly as\n",
      "if he had told her that he was here to be where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you were going. What are you coming for?\" she said,\n",
      "letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post. And\n",
      "irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What am I coming for?\" he repeated, looking straight into her eyes.\n",
      "\"You know that I have come to be where you are,\" he said; \"I can't help\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the\n",
      "snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it\n",
      "had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front,\n",
      "plaintively and gloomily. All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her\n",
      "more splendid now. He had said what her soul longed to hear, though she\n",
      "feared it with her reason. She made no answer, and in her face he saw\n",
      "conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,\" he said humbly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"It's wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you're a good man, to\n",

      "expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily. And clutching\n",
      "at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into\n",
      "the corridor of the carriage. But in the little corridor she paused,\n",
      "going over in her imagination what had happened. Though she could not\n",
      "recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that the\n",
      "momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she was\n",
      "panic-stricken and blissful at it. After standing still a few seconds,\n",
      "she went into the carriage and sat down in her place. The overstrained\n",
      "condition which had tormented her before did not only come back, but was\n",
      "intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute\n",
      "that something would snap within her from the excessive tension. She did\n",
      "not sleep all night. But in that nervous tension, and in the visions\n",
      "that filled her imagination, there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy:\n",
      "on the contrary there was something blissful, glowing, and exhilarating.\n",

      "imposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at the moment\n",
      "as propping up the brim of his round hat. Catching sight of her, he came\n",
      "to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile, and\n",
      "his big, tired eyes looking straight at her. An unpleasant sensation\n",
      "gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance, as\n",
      "though she had expected to see him different. She was especially struck\n",
      "by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on\n",
      "meeting him. That feeling was an intimate, familiar feeling, like a\n",
      "consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in her relations with\n",

      "and out. If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed\n",
      "people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he\n",
      "seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever. He looked at\n",
      "people as if they were things. A nervous young man, a clerk in a law\n",
      "court, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look. The young man\n",
      "asked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even\n",
      "pushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a\n",
      "person. But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the\n",
      "young man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his\n",
      "self-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as\n",
      "a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky saw nothing and no one. He felt himself a king, not because he\n",
      "believed that he had made an impression on Anna--he did not yet believe\n",
      "that,--but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness\n",
      "and pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think. He\n",
      "felt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on\n",
      "one thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal. And he was\n",
      "happy at it. He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he had\n",
      "come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only meaning\n",
      "in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her. And when he got out\n",
      "of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight\n",
      "of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought.\n",
      "And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it now and was\n",
      "thinking of it. He did not sleep all night. When he was back in the\n",
      "carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had\n",
      "seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his fancy, making his\n",
      "heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless\n",
      "night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath. He paused near his\n",
      "compartment, waiting for her to get out. \"Once more,\" he said to\n",
      "himself, smiling unconsciously, \"once more I shall see her walk, her\n",
      "face; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.\" But\n",
      "before he caught sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the\n",
      "station-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd. \"Ah, yes!\n",
      "The husband.\" Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly\n",
      "the fact that there was a person attached to her, a husband. He knew\n",
      "that she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and\n",
      "only now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his\n",
      "legs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this husband calmly\n",
      "take her arm with a sense of property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely\n",
      "self-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent\n",
      "spine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation,\n",
      "such as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring,\n",
      "should find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied\n",
      "the water. Alexey Alexandrovitch's manner of walking, with a swing of\n",
      "the hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky. He could recognize\n",
      "in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her. But she was\n",
      "still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way,\n",
      "physically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with\n",
      "rapture. He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second\n",
      "class, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her. He\n",
      "saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a\n",
      "lover's insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her\n",
      "husband. \"No, she does not love him and cannot love him,\" he decided to\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too\n",
      "with joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round, and\n",
      "seeing him, turned again to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you passed a good night?\" he asked, bowing to her and her husband\n",
      "together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow\n",
      "on his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, very good,\" she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it,\n",
      "peeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she\n",
      "glanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although\n",
      "the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment. She glanced\n",
      "at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky. Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling who\n",
      "this was. Vronsky's composure and self-confidence here struck, like a\n",
      "scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count Vronsky,\" said Anna.\n",
      "\n",

      "indifferently, giving his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You set off with the mother and you return with the son,\" he said,\n",
      "articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was\n",
      "bestowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're back from leave, I suppose?\" he said, and without waiting for a\n",
      "reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: \"Well, were a great\n",
      "many tears shed at Moscow at parting?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he\n",
      "wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched\n",
      "his hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Delighted,\" he said coldly. \"On Mondays we're at home. Most fortunate,\"\n",
      "he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether, \"that I should just\n",
      "have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my devotion,\" he went\n",
      "on in the same jesting tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,\" she\n",
      "responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound\n",
      "of Vronsky's steps behind them. \"But what has it to do with me?\" she\n",
      "said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had got\n",
      "on without her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, capitally! Mariette says he has been very good, And ... I must\n",
      "disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has. But\n",
      "once more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day. Our dear _Samovar_ will\n",
      "be delighted.\" (He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well known\n",
      "in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with\n",

      "know, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.\n",
      "You know how she takes everything to heart. Just now, with all her own\n",

      "\n",
      "The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband's, and the\n",

      "to my committee. I shall not be alone at dinner again,\" Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone. \"You wouldn't\n",

      "The first person to meet Anna at home was her son. He dashed down the\n",
      "stairs to her, in spite of the governess's call, and with desperate joy\n",
      "shrieked: \"Mother! mother!\" Running up to her, he hung on her neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you it was mother!\" he shouted to the governess. \"I knew!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to\n",
      "disappointment. She had imagined him better than he was in reality. She\n",
      "had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really\n",
      "was. But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue\n",
      "eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up\n",
      "stockings. Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of\n",
      "his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his\n",
      "simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his naive questions.\n",
      "Anna took out the presents Dolly's children had sent him, and told her\n",

      "Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's all over, but it was all much less serious than we had\n",

      "\n",
      "But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and\n",
      "sometimes I'm quite unhinged by it. The Society of the Little Sisters\"\n",
      "(this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution) \"was going\n",
      "splendidly, but with these gentlemen it's impossible to do anything,\"\n",
      "added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to\n",
      "destiny. \"They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and then work it out\n",
      "so pettily and unworthily. Two or three people, your husband among them,\n",
      "understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag\n",
      "it down. Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna\n",
      "described the purport of his letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against\n",
      "the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn't notice\n",

      "yet she's always angry; and she always has enemies, and always enemies\n",
      "in the name of Christianity and doing good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief\n",
      "secretary, who told her all the news of the town. At three o'clock she\n",
      "too went away, promising to come to dinner. Alexey Alexandrovitch was at\n",
      "the ministry. Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in assisting\n",
      "at her son's dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in putting her\n",
      "things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters\n",
      "which had accumulated on her table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and\n",
      "her excitement, too, had completely vanished. In the habitual conditions\n",
      "of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day. \"What\n",
      "was it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put\n",
      "a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done. To speak of it to my\n",
      "husband would be unnecessary and out of the question. To speak of it\n",
      "would be to attach importance to what has no importance.\" She remembered\n",
      "how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her\n",
      "at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband's subordinates, and how\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world\n",
      "was exposed to such incidents, but that he had the fullest confidence in\n",
      "her tact, and could never lower her and himself by jealousy. \"So then\n",
      "there's no reason to speak of it? And indeed, thank God, there's nothing\n",

      "He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions,\n",
      "and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary. At dinner\n",
      "time (there were always a few people dining with the Karenins) there\n",
      "arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief\n",
      "secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who had been\n",
      "recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service. Anna went into the\n",
      "drawing room to receive these guests. Precisely at five o'clock, before\n",
      "the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two\n",

      "Alexandrovitch's life was portioned out and occupied. And to make time\n",
      "to get through all that lay before him every day, he adhered to the\n",
      "strictest punctuality. \"Unhasting and unresting,\" was his motto. He came\n",
      "into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling\n",
      "to his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn't believe how uncomfortable\" (he\n",

      "\n",
      "At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and, with\n",
      "a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the\n",
      "conversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg\n",
      "official and public news. After dinner he spent half an hour with his\n",
      "guests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife's hand, withdrew, and\n",
      "drove off to the council. Anna did not go out that evening either to the\n",
      "Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had invited her,\n",
      "nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening. She did not go\n",
      "out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready.\n",
      "Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests, to the\n",
      "consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed. She was generally a\n",
      "mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense, and before\n",
      "leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform.\n",
      "The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized, and\n",
      "they ought to have been ready three days before. It appeared that two\n",
      "dresses had not been done at all, while the other one had not been\n",
      "altered as Anna had intended. The dressmaker came to explain, declaring\n",
      "that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna was so furious that\n",
      "she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards. To regain her\n",
      "serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent the whole\n",
      "evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with the cross,\n",
      "and tucked him up. She was glad she had not gone out anywhere, and had\n",
      "spent the evening so well. She felt so light-hearted and serene, she saw\n",
      "so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway\n",
      "journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable\n",
      "life, and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or\n",
      "before herself. Anna sat down at the hearth with an English novel and\n",
      "waited for her husband. Exactly at half-past nine she heard his ring,\n",
      "and he came into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here you are at last!\" she observed, holding out her hand to him.\n",

      "\"Oh, yes,\" she said, and she began telling him about everything from the\n",
      "beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back\n",
      "again,\" he went on. \"Come, what do they say about the new act I have got\n",
      "passed in the council?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at\n",

      "importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,\" he said, with\n",

      "She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant\n",
      "to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling it. With\n",

      "he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him across\n",
      "the room to his study. \"What are you reading now?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just now I'm reading Duc de Lille, _Poesie des Enfers,_\" he answered.\n",

      "Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and,\n",
      "putting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.\n",
      "She knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the\n",
      "evening. She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which\n",
      "swallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to\n",
      "keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.\n",
      "She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing with\n",
      "politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign to his\n",
      "nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it, Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art, but made\n",
      "it his duty to read everything. She knew that in politics, in\n",
      "philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and\n",
      "made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all,\n",
      "of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had the\n",
      "most distinct and decided opinions. He was fond of talking about\n",
      "Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of\n",
      "poetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very\n",
      "conspicuous consistency.\n",

      "\"Well, God be with you,\" she said at the door of the study, where a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All the same he's a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in\n",
      "his own line,\" Anna said to herself going back to her room, as though\n",

      "Precisely at twelve o'clock, when Anna was still sitting at her writing\n",

      "steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed,\n",
      "with a book under his arm, came in to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's time, it's time,\" said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into\n",

      "\n",
      "When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set\n",
      "of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and\n",
      "not merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt. Towards evening\n",
      "he was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of\n",
      "ludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his\n",
      "comrades and his superior officers. On arriving at twelve o'clock from\n",
      "the station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired\n",
      "carriage familiar to him. While still outside his own door, as he rang,\n",
      "he heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and\n",
      "Petritsky's voice. \"If that's one of the villains, don't let him in!\"\n",
      "Vronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped quietly into\n",
      "the first room. Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky's, with a rosy\n",
      "little face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and\n",
      "filling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat at\n",
      "the round table making coffee. Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the\n",
      "cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from\n",
      "duty, were sitting each side of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bravo! Vronsky!\" shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his chair.\n",
      "\"Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee\n",
      "pot. Why, we didn't expect you! Hope you're satisfied with the ornament\n",
      "of your study,\" he said, indicating the baroness. \"You know each other,\n",
      "of course?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think so,\" said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the\n",
      "baroness's little hand. \"What next! I'm an old friend.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're home after a journey,\" said the baroness, \"so I'm flying. Oh,\n",
      "I'll be off this minute, if I'm in the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're home, wherever you are, baroness,\" said Vronsky. \"How do you do,\n",
      "Kamerovsky?\" he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, you never know how to say such pretty things,\" said the\n",
      "baroness, turning to Petritsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; what's that for? After dinner I say things quite as good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After dinner there's no credit in them? Well, then, I'll make you some\n",
      "coffee, so go and wash and get ready,\" said the baroness, sitting down\n",
      "again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot. \"Pierre,\n",
      "give me the coffee,\" she said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called\n",
      "Pierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her\n",
      "relations with him. \"I'll put it in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll spoil it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I won't spoil it! Well, and your wife?\" said the baroness suddenly,\n",
      "interrupting Vronsky's conversation with his comrade. \"We've been\n",
      "marrying you here. Have you brought your wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, baroness. I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So much the better, so much the better. Shake hands on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes,\n",
      "about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am I to do?\"\n",
      "(_He_ was her husband.) \"Now I want to begin a suit against him. What do\n",
      "you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it's boiling over. You\n",
      "see, I'm engrossed with business! I want a lawsuit, because I must have\n",
      "my property. Do you understand the folly of it, that on the pretext of\n",
      "my being unfaithful to him,\" she said contemptuously, \"he wants to get\n",
      "the benefit of my fortune.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty\n",
      "woman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether\n",
      "dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.\n",
      "In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed\n",
      "classes. One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all,\n",
      "ridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the\n",
      "one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent, a\n",
      "woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one\n",
      "ought to bring up one's children, earn one's bread, and pay one's debts;\n",
      "and various similar absurdities. This was the class of old-fashioned and\n",
      "ridiculous people. But there was another class of people, the real\n",
      "people. To this class they all belonged, and in it the great thing was\n",
      "to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself without a blush\n",
      "to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of\n",
      "a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow. But\n",
      "immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped\n",
      "back into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over every one, and\n",
      "boiled away, doing just what was required of it--that is, providing much\n",
      "cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the\n",
      "baroness's gown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well now, good-bye, or you'll never get washed, and I shall have on my\n",
      "conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit. So you would advise a\n",
      "knife to his throat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.\n",
      "He'll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,\" answered\n",
      "Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So at the Francais!\" and, with a rustle of her skirts, she vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook\n",
      "hands and went off to his dressing room.\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his\n",
      "position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg. No\n",
      "money at all. His father said he wouldn't give him any and pay his\n",
      "debts. His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow,\n",
      "too, was threatening to get him locked up. The colonel of the regiment\n",
      "had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to\n",
      "leave. As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially\n",
      "since she'd taken to offering continually to lend him money. But he had\n",
      "found a girl--he'd show her to Vronsky--a marvel, exquisite, in the\n",
      "strict Oriental style, \"genre of the slave Rebecca, don't you know.\"\n",
      "He'd had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to\n",
      "him, but of course it would come to nothing. Altogether everything was\n",
      "supremely amusing and jolly. And, not letting his comrade enter into\n",
      "further details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the\n",
      "interesting news. As he listened to Petritsky's familiar stories in the\n",
      "familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in,\n",
      "Vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless\n",
      "Petersburg life that he was used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible!\" he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in\n",
      "which he had been sousing his healthy red neck. \"Impossible!\" he cried,\n",
      "at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to\n",
      "Mileev. \"And is he as stupid and pleased as ever? Well, and how's\n",
      "Buzulukov?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov--simply lovely!\" cried Petritsky.\n",
      "\"You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court\n",
      "ball. He went to a big ball in a new helmet. Have you seen the new\n",
      "helmets? Very nice, lighter. Well, so he's standing.... No, I say, do\n",
      "listen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am listening,\" answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as\n",
      "ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new helmets.\n",
      "The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the\n",
      "ambassador. They see our friend standing there.\" (Petritsky mimicked how\n",
      "he was standing with the helmet.) \"The Grand Duchess asked him to give\n",
      "her the helmet; he doesn't give it to her. What do you think of that?\n",
      "Well, every one's winking at him, nodding, frowning--give it to her, do!\n",
      "He doesn't give it to her. He's mute as a fish. Only picture it!...\n",
      "Well, the ... what's his name, whatever he was ... tries to take the\n",
      "helmet from him ... he won't give it up!... He pulls it from him, and\n",
      "hands it to the Grand Duchess. 'Here, your Highness,' says he, 'is the\n",
      "new helmet.' She turned the helmet the other side up, And--just picture\n",
      "it!--plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of\n",
      "sweetmeats!... He'd been storing them up, the darling!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky burst into roars of laughter. And long afterwards, when he was\n",
      "talking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing\n",
      "his strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet,\n",
      "got into his uniform, and went off to report himself. He intended, when\n",
      "he had done that, to drive to his brother's and to Betsy's and to pay\n",
      "several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he\n",
      "might meet Madame Karenina. As he always did in Petersburg, he left home\n",
      "not meaning to return till late at night.\n",

      "At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys' house, a consultation\n",
      "was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty's health\n",
      "and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength. She had\n",
      "been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse. The family doctor gave\n",
      "her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first\n",
      "and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his\n",
      "advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was\n",
      "called in. The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still\n",
      "youngish, asked to examine the patient. He maintained, with peculiar\n",
      "satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of\n",
      "barbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still\n",
      "youngish to handle a young girl naked. He thought it natural because he\n",
      "did it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as\n",
      "he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely\n",
      "as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors\n",
      "had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the\n",
      "same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a\n",
      "bad doctor, in the princess's household and circle it was for some\n",
      "reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special\n",
      "knowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty. After a careful\n",
      "examination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame,\n",
      "the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was\n",
      "standing in the drawing room talking to the prince. The prince frowned\n",
      "and coughed, listening to the doctor. As a man who had seen something of\n",
      "life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine,\n",
      "and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he was\n",
      "perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty's\n",
      "illness. \"Conceited blockhead!\" he thought, as he listened to the\n",
      "celebrated doctor's chatter about his daughter's symptoms. The doctor\n",
      "was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt\n",
      "for this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level\n",
      "of his intelligence. He perceived that it was no good talking to the old\n",
      "man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother. Before\n",
      "her he decided to scatter his pearls. At that instant the princess came\n",
      "into the drawing room with the family doctor. The prince withdrew,\n",
      "trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance. The\n",
      "princess was distracted, and did not know what to do. She felt she had\n",
      "sinned against Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, doctor, decide our fate,\" said the princess. \"Tell me\n",
      "everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there hope?\" she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could\n",
      "not utter the question. \"Well, doctor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Immediately, princess. I will talk it over with my colleague, and then\n",
      "I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we had better leave you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess went out with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly\n",
      "explaining his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous\n",
      "trouble, but ... and so on. The celebrated doctor listened to him, and\n",
      "in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said he. \"But...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are\n",
      "aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing\n",
      "definite. But we may suspect it. And there are indications;\n",
      "malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on. The question stands thus:\n",
      "in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to\n",
      "maintain nutrition?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in\n",
      "these cases,\" the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a\n",
      "subtle smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's an understood thing,\" responded the celebrated physician,\n",
      "again glancing at his watch. \"Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet,\n",
      "or shall I have to drive around?\" he asked. \"Ah! it is. Oh, well, then I\n",
      "can do it in twenty minutes. So we were saying the problem may be put\n",
      "thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves. The one is\n",
      "in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides at once.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And how about a tour abroad?\" asked the family doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there is an early\n",
      "stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign\n",
      "tour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving nutrition,\n",
      "and not for lowering it.\" And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan\n",
      "of treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily\n",
      "on the ground that they could do no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the\n",
      "removal from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the mother\n",
      "wishes it,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go. Only, those German\n",
      "quacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let them\n",
      "go then.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He glanced once more at his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! time's up already,\" And he went to the door. The celebrated doctor\n",
      "announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated\n",
      "his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! another examination!\" cried the mother, with horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, only a few details, princess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come this way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to\n",
      "Kitty. Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left\n",
      "there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the\n",
      "middle of the room. When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her\n",
      "eyes filled with tears. All her illness and treatment struck her as a\n",
      "thing so stupid, ludicrous even! Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd\n",
      "as putting together the pieces of a broken vase. Her heart was broken.\n",
      "Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders? But she could not\n",
      "grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered herself to blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May I trouble you to sit down, princess?\" the celebrated doctor said to\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began\n",
      "asking her tiresome questions. She answered him, and all at once got up,\n",
      "furious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. This is the\n",
      "third time you've asked me the same thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The celebrated doctor did not take offense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nervous irritability,\" he said to the princess, when Kitty had left the\n",
      "room. \"However, I had finished...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an\n",
      "exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess,\n",
      "and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were\n",
      "certainly harmless. At the question: Should they go abroad? the doctor\n",
      "plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.\n",
      "Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put\n",
      "no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after\n",
      "the doctor had gone. The mother was much more cheerful when she went\n",
      "back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful. She had\n",
      "often, almost always, to be pretending now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Really, I'm quite well, mamma. But if you want to go abroad, let's go!\"\n",
      "she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour, she\n",

      "her husband's government official set, consisting of his colleagues and\n",
      "subordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious\n",
      "manner, and belonging to different social strata. Anna found it\n",

      "day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time. She was\n",
      "conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her\n",
      "lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for\n",
      "daring to pursue her. Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at\n",
      "a _soiree_ where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him\n",
      "there, she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she\n",
      "had been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not\n",
      "distasteful to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the\n",
      "fashionable world was in the theater. Vronsky, seeing his cousin from\n",

      "her box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why didn't you come to dinner?\" she said to him. \"I marvel at the\n",

      "could hear; \"_she wasn't there_. But come after the opera.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky looked inquiringly at her. She nodded. He thanked her by a\n",

      "\"But how I remember your jeers!\" continued Princess Betsy, who took a\n",
      "peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.\n",
      "\"What's become of all that? You're caught, my dear boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's my one desire, to be caught,\" answered Vronsky, with his serene,\n",
      "good-humored smile. \"If I complain of anything it's only that I'm not\n",
      "caught enough, to tell the truth. I begin to lose hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, whatever hope can you have?\" said Betsy, offended on behalf of her\n",
      "friend. \"_Entendons nous...._\" But in her eyes there were gleams of\n",
      "light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he\n",
      "did what hope he might have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"None whatever,\" said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows of\n",
      "teeth. \"Excuse me,\" he added, taking an opera glass out of her hand, and\n",
      "proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes\n",
      "facing them. \"I'm afraid I'm becoming ridiculous.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the\n",
      "eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people. He was very well aware\n",
      "that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or\n",
      "of any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous. But the position of a\n",
      "man pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his\n",
      "life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand about\n",
      "it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and gay\n",
      "smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera glass and looked at\n",
      "his cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why was it you didn't come to dinner?\" she said, admiring him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must tell you about that. I was busily employed, and doing what, do\n",
      "you suppose? I'll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you'd never\n",
      "guess. I've been reconciling a husband with a man who'd insulted his\n",

      "\"Can't help it. I've an appointment there, all to do with my mission of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"'Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven,'\" said\n",
      "Betsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But I shall guess, so much the better.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "an ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter\n",
      "upstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not\n",
      "perfectly intelligible in the letter.\"\n",

      "\"That's the most interesting part of the story. It appears that it's a\n",

      "his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express them, he begins\n",
      "to get hot and say nasty things, and again I'm obliged to trot out all\n",
      "my diplomatic talents. I allowed that their conduct was bad, but I urged\n",
      "him to take into consideration their heedlessness, their youth; then,\n",
      "too, the young men had only just been lunching together. 'You\n",

      "again as soon as the thing was about at an end, our friend the\n",

      "\"Well, _bonne chance_!\" she added, giving Vronsky one finger of the hand\n",

      "liked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a capital\n",
      "fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the regiment, the\n",
      "young Prince Kedrov. And what was most important, the interests of the\n",
      "regiment were involved in it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the young men were in Vronsky's company. The colonel of the\n",

      "wife, so Venden told the story--he had been married half a year--was at\n",
      "church with her mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising\n",
      "from her interesting condition, she could not remain standing, she drove\n",
      "home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she came across. On the\n",
      "spot the officers set off in pursuit of her; she was alarmed, and\n",
      "feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase home. Venden himself, on\n",
      "returning from his office, heard a ring at their bell and voices, went\n",
      "out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he had turned\n",
      "them out. He asked for exemplary punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's all very well,\" said the colonel to Vronsky, whom he had\n",
      "invited to come and see him. \"Petritsky's becoming impossible. Not a\n",
      "week goes by without some scandal. This government clerk won't let it\n",
      "drop, he'll go on with the thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could\n",
      "be no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften\n",
      "the government clerk, and hush the matter up. The colonel had called in\n",
      "Vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man,\n",
      "and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment. They\n",
      "talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with\n",
      "Vronsky to Venden's to apologize. The colonel and Vronsky were both\n",
      "fully aware that Vronsky's name and rank would be sure to contribute\n",
      "greatly to the softening of the injured husband's feelings.\n",

      "\n",
      "On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the\n",
      "colonel, and reported to him his success, or non-success. The colonel,\n",
      "thinking it all over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter further,\n",
      "but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine Vronsky\n",
      "about his interview; and it was a long while before he could restrain\n",
      "his laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk, after\n",
      "subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he recalled the\n",
      "details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of conciliation,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's a disgraceful story, but killing. Kedrov really can't fight the\n",

      "rights, and order tea in the big drawing room, when one after another\n",

      "Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure\n",

      "near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing room,\n",
      "round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply\n",

      "Princess Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her\n",
      "manners, and nicknamed _enfant terrible_. Princess Myakaya, sitting in\n",

      "\n",
      "Not he, but she, was confused.\n",
      "\n",

      "there's no chance of it?\" he murmured with his lips; but she heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said. But\n",

      "with the reflection of life. And every time he had stumbled against life\n",
      "itself he had shrunk away from it. Now he experienced a feeling akin to\n",
      "that of a man who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should\n",
      "suddenly discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm\n",
      "below. That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in\n",
      "which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived. For the first time the question\n",
      "presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife's loving someone\n",
      "else, and he was horrified at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over\n",
      "the resounding parquet of the dining room, where one lamp was burning,\n",
      "over the carpet of the dark drawing room, in which the light was\n",
      "reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and\n",
      "across her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits\n",
      "of her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her\n",
      "writing table, that he knew so well. He walked across her boudoir to the\n",
      "bedroom door, and turned back again. At each turn in his walk,\n",
      "especially at the parquet of the lighted dining room, he halted and said\n",
      "to himself, \"Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must express\n",
      "my view of it and my decision.\" And he turned back again. \"But express\n",
      "what--what decision?\" he said to himself in the drawing room, and he\n",
      "found no reply. \"But after all,\" he asked himself before turning into\n",
      "the boudoir, \"what has occurred? Nothing. She was talking a long while\n",
      "with him. But what of that? Surely women in society can talk to whom\n",
      "they please. And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and her,\" he\n",
      "told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum, which had\n",
      "always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and no meaning\n",
      "at all. And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he\n",
      "entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not\n",
      "so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something.\n",
      "And he said to himself again in the dining room, \"Yes, I must decide and\n",
      "put a stop to it, and express my view of it...\" And again at the turn in\n",
      "the drawing room he asked himself, \"Decide how?\" And again he asked\n",
      "himself, \"What had occurred?\" and answered, \"Nothing,\" and recollected\n",
      "that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife; but again in the\n",
      "drawing room he was convinced that something had happened. His thoughts,\n",
      "like his body, went round a complete circle, without coming upon\n",
      "anything new. He noticed this, rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her\n",
      "boudoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at\n",
      "the top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed. He\n",
      "began to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling. For the\n",
      "first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas,\n",
      "her desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate life\n",
      "of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it. It\n",
      "was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into. To put himself in\n",
      "thought and feeling in another person's place was a spiritual exercise\n",
      "not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch. He looked on this spiritual\n",
      "exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And the worst of it all,\" thought he, \"is that just now, at the very\n",
      "moment when my great work is approaching completion\" (he was thinking of\n",
      "the project he was bringing forward at the time), \"when I stand in need\n",
      "of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid worry\n",
      "should fall foul of me. But what's to be done? I'm not one of those men\n",
      "who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character\n",
      "to face them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind,\"\n",
      "he said aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in\n",
      "her soul, that's not my affair; that's the affair of her conscience, and\n",
      "falls under the head of religion,\" he said to himself, feeling\n",
      "consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of\n",
      "regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And so,\" Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, \"questions as to her\n",
      "feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can\n",
      "have nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. As the head of the\n",
      "family, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in\n",
      "part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I\n",
      "perceive, to warn her, even to use my authority. I ought to speak\n",
      "plainly to her.\" And everything that he would say tonight to his wife\n",
      "took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch's head. Thinking over what he\n",
      "would say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and\n",
      "mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for it,\n",
      "but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before him\n",
      "shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial\n",
      "report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition of\n",
      "the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly,\n",
      "exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be,\n",
      "reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly,\n",
      "reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.\" And,\n",
      "interlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the\n",
      "joints of the fingers cracked. This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of\n",
      "his fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, so\n",
      "needful to him at this juncture.\n",

      "likely that she was simply sleepy! She felt herself clad in an\n",

      "noticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy,\n",
      "every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once;\n",
      "to him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind,\n",

      "his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world--he had\n",
      "unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her\n",

      "again. She both feared his speaking and wished for it. But he was\n",
      "silent. She waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten\n",
      "about him. She thought of that other; she pictured him, and felt how her\n",

      "was further than ever from marriage. He was painfully conscious himself,\n",

      "he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it, that\n",
      "recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind,\n",

      "to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was far from\n",

      "all done by hired labor, not on half-profits. The bailiff listened\n",
      "attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer's\n",
      "projects. But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always\n",
      "irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency. That look said:\n",
      "\"That's all very well, but as God wills.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was the tone common\n",

      "than forty--thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight--laborers for a\n",
      "reasonable sum. Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.\n",

      "into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity,\n",
      "stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were,\n",
      "for guidance. If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and\n",
      "farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country. Swaying rhythmically\n",
      "with the ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the warm yet\n",
      "fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he rode through his forest over\n",
      "the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with\n",
      "dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving\n",
      "on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots. When he came out of the\n",
      "forest, in the immense plain before him, his grass fields stretched in\n",
      "an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only\n",
      "spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow. He\n",
      "was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants' horses and\n",
      "colts trampling down his young grass (he told a peasant he met to drive\n",
      "them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat,\n",
      "whom he met on the way, and asked, \"Well, Ipat, shall we soon be\n",
      "sowing?\" \"We must get the ploughing done first, Konstantin\n",
      "Dmitrievitch,\" answered Ipat. The further he rode, the happier he\n",
      "became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the\n",
      "last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders, so\n",
      "that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six\n",
      "fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard at\n",
      "the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct\n",
      "movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land. And then\n",
      "eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four\n",
      "hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so\n",
      "as not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had\n",
      "been sent to sow clover. A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at\n",
      "the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been\n",
      "torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse. Both the laborers were\n",
      "sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together. The earth in the\n",
      "cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder, but\n",
      "crusted together or adhering in clods. Seeing the master, the laborer,\n",
      "Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work sowing. This\n",
      "was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his\n",
      "temper. When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead the horse to the\n",
      "hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right, sir, it'll spring up again,\" responded Vassily.\n",

      "\"Please don't argue,\" said Levin, \"but do as you're told.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" answered Vassily, and he took the horse's head. \"What a\n",
      "sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,\" he said, hesitating; \"first rate. Only\n",
      "it's a work to get about! You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.\"\n",

      "rolling the earth in his palms.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent. It had\n",

      "he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.\n",
      "Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only\n",
      "keep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank\n",
      "deep in at each step. The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a\n",
      "couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing. Everything was\n",
      "capital, everything was cheering. Levin rode back across the streams,\n",
      "hoping the water would have gone down. And he did in fact get across,\n",
      "and startled two ducks. \"There must be snipe too,\" he thought, and just\n",

      "confirmed his theory about the snipe.\n",

      "brother Nikolay? He did say: 'Maybe I'll go to the waters, or maybe I'll\n",

      "that his brother Nikolay's presence should come to disturb his happy\n",
      "mood of spring. But he felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once he\n",
      "opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a softened feeling of\n",
      "joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that it was his\n",

      "he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station, and a\n",

      "Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans\n",
      "for the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been\n",
      "reading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which really was,\n",
      "though he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books on\n",
      "agriculture. Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding\n",
      "everything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on this\n",
      "visit, and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were, and a\n",

      "\n",
      "The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be\n",

      "and salted mushrooms, and in Levin's finally ordering the soup to be\n",
      "served without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook had\n",

      "Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he thought\n",
      "everything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter,\n",
      "and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup, and\n",
      "the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine--everything was\n",
      "superb and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid, splendid!\" he said, lighting a fat cigar after the roast. \"I\n",
      "feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the\n",
      "noise and jolting of a steamer. And so you maintain that the laborer\n",
      "himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of\n",
      "methods in agriculture. Of course, I'm an ignorant outsider; but I\n",
      "should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the\n",
      "laborer too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but wait a bit. I'm not talking of political economy, I'm talking\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, we'd better drive,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting into the\n",
      "trap. He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him, and lighted a\n",
      "cigar. \"How is it you don't smoke? A cigar is a sort of thing, not\n",
      "exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure. Come,\n",
      "this is life! How splendid it is! This is how I should like to live!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing\n",
      "tact, that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so\n",

      "\n",
      "Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and\n",

      "From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained,\n",

      "\n",
      "In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year's\n",
      "leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!\" Levin said to\n",
      "himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade\n",
      "of young grass. He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet\n",
      "mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the\n",
      "sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes\n",
      "at the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings;\n",
      "another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and\n",
      "vanished. The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the\n",
      "thicket. An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped\n",
      "cautiously a few steps forward, and putting her head on one side, began\n",
      "to listen intently. Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo. Twice she\n",
      "uttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and\n",
      "broke down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Imagine! the cuckoo already!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out from\n",
      "behind a bush.\n",

      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch's figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw\n",

      "blue smoke of a cigarette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tchk! tchk!\" came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking his\n",
      "gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's that cry?\" asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin's attention to a\n",
      "prolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice, in play.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't you know it? That's the hare. But enough talking! Listen,\n",
      "it's flying!\" almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so\n",
      "well known to the sportsman, two seconds later--another, a third, and\n",
      "after the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him\n",
      "against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of\n",
      "the aspens, he saw the flying bird. It was flying straight towards him;\n",
      "the guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded\n",
      "close to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and\n",
      "at the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where\n",
      "Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped\n",
      "like an arrow, and darted upwards again. Again came the red flash and\n",
      "the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep\n",
      "up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with\n",
      "a heavy splash on the slushy ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can I have missed it?\" shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not see\n",
      "for the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here it is!\" said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear raised,\n",
      "wagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she would\n",
      "prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead bird to\n",
      "her master. \"Well, I'm glad you were successful,\" said Levin, who, at\n",
      "the same time, had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting\n",
      "the snipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was a bad shot from the right barrel,\" responded Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, loading his gun. \"Sh... it's flying!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again. Two\n",
      "snipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying,\n",
      "flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen. There was the report\n",
      "of four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in\n",
      "the air and vanished from sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stand-shooting was capital. Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds\n",
      "and Levin two, of which one was not found. It began to get dark. Venus,\n",
      "bright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west\n",
      "behind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights\n",
      "of Arcturus. Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear\n",
      "and lost them again. The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to\n",
      "stay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch,\n",
      "should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly\n",
      "plain. Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear\n",
      "with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky,\n",
      "yet still he waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it time to go home?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's stay a little while,\" answered Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stiva!\" said Levin unexpectedly; \"how is it you don't tell me whether\n",
      "your sister-in-law's married yet, or when she's going to be?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could\n",
      "affect him. But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch\n",
      "replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's never thought of being married, and isn't thinking of it; but\n",
      "she's very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. They're positively\n",
      "afraid she may not live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What!\" cried Levin. \"Very ill? What is wrong with her? How has she...?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking\n",
      "upwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They have chosen a time to talk,\" she was thinking. \"It's on the\n",
      "wing.... Here it is, yes, it is. They'll miss it,\" thought Laska.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as\n",
      "it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and\n",
      "two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant. The\n",
      "snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a\n",
      "thicket, bending down the delicate shoots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid! Together!\" cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the\n",
      "thicket to look for the snipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?\" he wondered. \"Yes, Kitty's\n",
      "ill.... Well, it can't be helped; I'm very sorry,\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's found it! Isn't she a clever thing?\" he said, taking the warm\n",
      "bird from Laska's mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.\n",
      "\"I've got it, Stiva!\" he shouted.\n",

      "On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty's illness and the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys' plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit\n",
      "it, he was pleased at what he heard. He was pleased that there was still\n",
      "hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made\n",
      "him suffer so much. But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the\n",
      "causes of Kitty's illness, and mentioned Vronsky's name, Levin cut him\n",
      "short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the\n",
      "truth, no interest in them either.\"\n",

      "as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?\" asked Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.\n",
      "Eight straight away, and the rest in six years. I've been bothering\n",
      "about it for ever so long. No one would give more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you've as good as given away your forest for nothing,\" said Levin\n",
      "gloomily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you mean for nothing?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\n",
      "good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin's eyes\n",
      "now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the\n",
      "acre,\" answered Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, these farmers!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully. \"Your tone of\n",
      "contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to business, we do\n",
      "it better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned it all out,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and the forest is fetching a very good price--so much so that I'm\n",
      "afraid of this fellow's crying off, in fact. You know it's not\n",
      "'timber,'\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to\n",
      "convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts. \"And it won't\n",
      "run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he's giving\n",
      "me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin smiled contemptuously. \"I know,\" he thought, \"that fashion not\n",
      "only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten years\n",
      "in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and\n",
      "out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it. '_Timber,\n",
      "run to so many yards the acre._' He says those words without\n",
      "understanding them himself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't attempt to teach you what you write about in your office,\"\n",
      "said he, \"and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it. But\n",
      "you're so positive you know all the lore of the forest. It's difficult.\n",
      "Have you counted the trees?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How count the trees?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying\n",
      "to draw his friend out of his ill-temper. \"Count the sands of the sea,\n",
      "number the stars. Some higher power might do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever\n",
      "buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them\n",
      "for nothing, as you're doing now. I know your forest. I go there every\n",
      "year shooting, and your forest's worth a hundred and fifty roubles an\n",
      "acre paid down, while he's giving you sixty by installments. So that in\n",
      "fact you're making him a present of thirty thousand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, don't let your imagination run away with you,\" said Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch piteously. \"Why was it none would give it, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he's bought\n",
      "them off. I've had to do with all of them; I know them. They're not\n",
      "merchants, you know: they're speculators. He wouldn't look at a bargain\n",
      "that gave him ten, fifteen per cent profit, but holds back to buy a\n",
      "rouble's worth for twenty kopecks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, enough of it! You're out of temper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not the least,\" said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather,\n",
      "with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps. In the\n",
      "trap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as\n",
      "coachman. Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the friends\n",
      "in the hall. Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man, with\n",
      "mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent muddy-looking\n",
      "eyes. He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the\n",
      "waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and\n",
      "straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them. He rubbed his\n",
      "face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him his coat, which sat\n",
      "extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his\n",
      "hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So here you are,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.\n",
      "\"That's capital.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not venture to disregard your excellency's commands, though the\n",
      "road was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way, but I am here\n",
      "at my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects\"; he turned to Levin,\n",
      "trying to seize his hand too. But Levin, scowling, made as though he did\n",
      "not notice his hand, and took out the snipe. \"Your honors have been\n",
      "diverting yourselves with the chase? What kind of bird may it be, pray?\"\n",
      "added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: \"a great delicacy,\n",
      "I suppose.\" And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had grave\n",
      "doubts whether this game were worth the candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you like to go into my study?\" Levin said in French to Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely. \"Go into my study; you can talk there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so, where you please,\" said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity,\n",
      "as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties\n",
      "as to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about\n",
      "anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though\n",
      "seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross\n",
      "himself. He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same\n",
      "dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled\n",
      "contemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means\n",
      "willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, have you brought the money?\" asked Oblonsky. \"Sit down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't trouble about the money. I've come to see you to talk it\n",
      "over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is there to talk over? But do sit down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't mind if I do,\" said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his\n",
      "elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest\n",
      "discomfort to himself. \"You must knock it down a bit, prince. It would\n",
      "be too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing. As to\n",
      "paying the money down, there'll be no hitch there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was\n",
      "just going out of the door, but catching the merchant's words, he\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, you've got the forest for nothing as it is,\" he said. \"He came to\n",
      "me too late, or I'd have fixed the price for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and\n",
      "up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,\" he said with a\n",
      "smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; \"there's positively no dealing\n",
      "with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I\n",
      "offered too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn't pick it up on the\n",
      "ground, nor steal it either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us! nowadays there's no chance at all of stealing. With the\n",
      "open courts and everything done in style, nowadays there's no question\n",
      "of stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His\n",
      "excellency's asking too much for the forest. I can't make both ends meet\n",
      "over it. I must ask for a little concession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But is the thing settled between you or not? If it's settled, it's\n",
      "useless haggling; but if it's not,\" said Levin, \"I'll buy the forest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin's face. A hawklike, greedy,\n",
      "cruel expression was left upon it. With rapid, bony fingers he\n",
      "unbuttoned his coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a\n",
      "watch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here you are, the forest is mine,\" he said, crossing himself quickly,\n",
      "and holding out his hand. \"Take the money; it's my forest. That's\n",
      "Ryabinin's way of doing business; he doesn't haggle over every\n",
      "half-penny,\" he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be in a hurry if I were you,\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, really,\" said Oblonsky in surprise. \"I've given my word, you\n",
      "know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin went out of the room, slamming the door. Ryabinin looked towards\n",
      "the door and shook his head with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all youthfulness--positively nothing but boyishness. Why, I'm\n",
      "buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that\n",
      "Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky. And\n",

      "\n",
      "Within an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and\n",
      "hooking up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself\n",
      "in his tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.\n",
      "\n",

      "lot!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so,\" responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning\n",

      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes,\n",
      "which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance. The\n",
      "business of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting\n",
      "had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of\n",
      "mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that\n",
      "had come upon Levin. He wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly\n",
      "as it had been begun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be\n",
      "affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control\n",
      "his mood. The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had\n",
      "gradually begun to work upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had\n",
      "slighted her. This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him. Vronsky had\n",
      "slighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin. Consequently Vronsky had\n",
      "the right to despise Levin, and therefore he was his enemy. But all this\n",
      "Levin did not think out. He vaguely felt that there was something in it\n",
      "insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him,\n",
      "but he fell foul of everything that presented itself. The stupid sale of\n",
      "the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in his\n",
      "house, exasperated him.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, damn him!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to\n",
      "which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of classes, I'm glad\n",
      "to belong. And their impoverishment is not due to extravagance--that\n",
      "would be nothing; living in good style--that's the proper thing for\n",
      "noblemen; it's only the nobles who know how to do it. Now the peasants\n",
      "about us buy land, and I don't mind that. The gentleman does nothing,\n",
      "while the peasant works and supplants the idle man. That's as it ought\n",

      "process of impoverishment from a sort of--I don't know what to call\n",
      "it--innocence. Here a Polish speculator bought for half its value a\n",
      "magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in Nice. And there a\n",
      "merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten roubles, as security\n",
      "for the loan of one rouble. Here, for no kind of reason, you've made\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course, they must be counted. You didn't count them, but Ryabinin\n",

      "\"Well, you must excuse me, but there's something mean in this counting.\n",

      "apparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only man who could,\n",
      "so he fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole\n",
      "life. Moreover, he felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took no delight\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To the stables!\" he said, and was just pulling out the letters to read\n",

      "The temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race\n",
      "course, and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day. He\n",
      "had not yet seen her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself,\n",
      "but had put her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he positively\n",
      "did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday and was\n",
      "today. He had scarcely got out of his carriage when his groom, the\n",
      "so-called \"stable boy,\" recognizing the carriage some way off, called\n",
      "the trainer. A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots and a short jacket,\n",
      "clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his chin, came to meet him,\n",
      "walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his elbows out and\n",
      "swaying from side to side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, how's Frou-Frou?\" Vronsky asked in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, sir,\" the Englishman's voice responded somewhere in the\n",
      "inside of his throat. \"Better not go in,\" he added, touching his hat.\n",
      "\"I've put a muzzle on her, and the mare's fidgety. Better not go in,\n",
      "it'll excite the mare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm going in. I want to look at her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along, then,\" said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with his\n",
      "mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in front with his\n",
      "disjointed gait.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went into the little yard in front of the shed. A stable boy,\n",
      "spruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his\n",
      "hand, and followed them. In the shed there were five horses in their\n",
      "separate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his chief rival, Gladiator, a\n",
      "very tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing\n",
      "among them. Even more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator,\n",
      "whom he had never seen. But he knew that by the etiquette of the race\n",
      "course it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but\n",
      "improper even to ask questions about him. Just as he was passing along\n",
      "the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the\n",
      "left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white\n",
      "legs. He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man\n",
      "turning away from the sight of another man's open letter, he turned\n",
      "round and went into Frou-Frou's stall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak... I never can say the name,\"\n",
      "said the Englishman, over his shoulder, pointing his big finger and\n",
      "dirty nail towards Gladiator's stall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mahotin? Yes, he's my most serious rival,\" said Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you were riding him,\" said the Englishman, \"I'd bet on you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Frou-Frou's more nervous; he's stronger,\" said Vronsky, smiling at the\n",
      "compliment to his riding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,\" said the\n",
      "Englishman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of pluck--that is, energy and courage--Vronsky did not merely feel that\n",
      "he had enough; what was of far more importance, he was firmly convinced\n",
      "that no one in the world could have more of this \"pluck\" than he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think I want more thinning down?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" answered the Englishman. \"Please, don't speak loud. The mare's\n",
      "fidgety,\" he added, nodding towards the horse-box, before which they\n",
      "were standing, and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the\n",
      "straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted\n",
      "by one little window. In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a\n",
      "muzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs. Looking round him\n",
      "in the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once\n",
      "more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare.\n",
      "Frou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from reproach,\n",
      "from a breeder's point of view. She was small-boned all over; though her\n",
      "chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow. Her hind-quarters\n",
      "were a little drooping, and in her fore-legs, and still more in her\n",
      "hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature. The muscles of both hind-\n",
      "and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her shoulders the mare was\n",
      "exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now that she was\n",
      "lean from training. The bones of her legs below the knees looked no\n",
      "thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily thick seen\n",
      "from the side. She looked altogether, except across the shoulders, as it\n",
      "were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth. But she had in\n",
      "the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten: that\n",
      "quality was _blood_, the blood _that tells_, as the English expression\n",
      "has it. The muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews,\n",
      "covered with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as satin, and they were\n",
      "hard as bone. Her clean-cut head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes,\n",
      "broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the\n",
      "cartilage within. About all her figure, and especially her head, there\n",
      "was a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness.\n",
      "She was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the\n",
      "mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he felt at\n",
      "that moment, looking at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and,\n",
      "turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she\n",
      "started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her\n",
      "muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, you see how fidgety she is,\" said the Englishman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There, darling! There!\" said Vronsky, going up to the mare and speaking\n",
      "soothingly to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the nearer he came, the more excited she grew. Only when he stood by\n",
      "her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under her\n",
      "soft, delicate coat. Vronsky patted her strong neck, straightened over\n",
      "her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other\n",
      "side, and moved his face near her dilated nostrils, transparent as a\n",
      "bat's wing. She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense\n",
      "nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her strong,\n",
      "black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his sleeve.\n",
      "But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began restlessly\n",
      "stamping one after the other her shapely legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quiet, darling, quiet!\" he said, patting her again over her\n",
      "hind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best\n",
      "possible condition, he went out of the horse-box.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mare's excitement had infected Vronsky. He felt that his heart was\n",
      "throbbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it\n",
      "was both dreadful and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I rely on you, then,\" he said to the Englishman; \"half-past six\n",
      "on the ground.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" said the Englishman. \"Oh, where are you going, my lord?\" he\n",
      "asked suddenly, using the title \"my lord,\" which he had scarcely ever\n",
      "used before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to\n",
      "stare, not into the Englishman's eyes, but at his forehead, astounded at\n",
      "the impertinence of his question. But realizing that in asking this the\n",
      "Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer, but as a jockey,\n",
      "he answered:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've got to go to Bryansky's; I shall be home within an hour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How often I'm asked that question today!\" he said to himself, and he\n",
      "blushed, a thing which rarely happened to him. The Englishman looked\n",
      "gravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where Vronsky was going, he\n",
      "added:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The great thing's to keep quiet before a race,\" said he; \"don't get out\n",
      "of temper or upset about anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his carriage,\n",
      "he told the man to drive to Peterhof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been\n",
      "threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a pity!\" thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage. \"It\n",
      "was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.\" As he sat in solitude\n",
      "in the closed carriage, he took out his mother's letter and his\n",
      "brother's note, and read them through.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it was the same thing over and over again. Everyone, his mother,\n",
      "his brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his\n",
      "heart. This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred--a\n",
      "feeling he had rarely known before. \"What business is it of theirs? Why\n",
      "does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me? And why do\n",
      "they worry me so? Just because they see that this is something they\n",
      "can't understand. If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they\n",
      "would have left me alone. They feel that this is something different,\n",
      "that this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than\n",
      "life. And this is incomprehensible, and that's why it annoys them.\n",
      "Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do\n",
      "not complain of it,\" he said, in the word _we_ linking himself with\n",
      "Anna. \"No, they must needs teach us how to live. They haven't an idea of\n",
      "what happiness is; they don't know that without our love, for us there\n",
      "is neither happiness nor unhappiness--no life at all,\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was angry with all of them for their interference just because he\n",
      "felt in his soul that they, all these people, were right. He felt that\n",
      "the love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which would\n",
      "pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in the life\n",
      "of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories. He felt all the torture\n",
      "of his own and her position, all the difficulty there was for them,\n",
      "conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in concealing\n",
      "their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving, feigning,\n",
      "and continually thinking of others, when the passion that united them\n",
      "was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but\n",
      "their love.\n",
      "\n",
      "He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable\n",
      "necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his natural bent.\n",
      "He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once\n",
      "detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit. And he\n",
      "experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since\n",
      "his secret love for Anna. This was a feeling of loathing for\n",
      "something--whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or for the\n",
      "whole world, he could not have said. But he always drove away this\n",
      "strange feeling. Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread of\n",
      "his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she cannot\n",
      "be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not show it.\n",
      "Yes, we must put an end to it,\" he decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was\n",
      "essential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the\n",
      "better. \"Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves somewhere\n",
      "alone with our love,\" he said to himself.\n",

      "in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet\n",
      "brilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs\n",
      "rushing streams of water. He thought no more of the shower spoiling the\n",
      "race course, but was rejoicing now that--thanks to the rain--he would be\n",
      "sure to find her at home and alone, as he knew that Alexey\n",

      "flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden. Vronsky forgot\n",
      "now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties\n",
      "of their position. He thought of nothing but that he would see her\n",
      "directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her, as she was in\n",
      "reality. He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as not to\n",
      "creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly remembered\n",
      "what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing side of his\n",
      "relations with her, her son with his questioning--hostile, as he\n",
      "fancied--eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.\n",
      "When he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid speaking\n",
      "of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone; they did\n",
      "not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not\n",
      "understand. They had made no agreement about this, it had settled\n",
      "itself. They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the\n",
      "child. In his presence they talked like acquaintances. But in spite of\n",
      "this caution, Vronsky often saw the child's intent, bewildered glance\n",
      "fixed upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time\n",
      "friendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy's manner to\n",
      "him; as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there\n",
      "existed some important bond, the significance of which he could not\n",
      "understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a fact, the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation,\n",
      "and he tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what\n",
      "feeling he ought to have for this man. With a child's keen instinct for\n",
      "every manifestation of feeling, he saw distinctly that his father, his\n",
      "governess, his nurse,--all did not merely dislike Vronsky, but looked on\n",
      "him with horror and aversion, though they never said anything about him,\n",
      "while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend.\n",

      "\"What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to love him? If I don't know,\n",

      "And this was what caused his dubious, inquiring, sometimes hostile,\n",
      "expression, and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky found so\n",
      "irksome. This child's presence always and infallibly called up in\n",
      "Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had\n",
      "experienced of late. This child's presence called up both in Vronsky and\n",
      "in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the\n",
      "compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the\n",
      "right one, but that to arrest his motion is not in his power, that every\n",
      "instant is carrying him further and further away, and that to admit to\n",

      "his certain ruin.\n",

      "manservant and a maid out to look for him. Dressed in a white gown,\n",
      "deeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind\n",
      "some flowers, and did not hear him. Bending her curly black head, she\n",
      "pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the\n",

      "\n",

      "out for a walk; they'll come in from this side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering.\n",

      "She spoke the truth. If ever at any moment she had been asked what she\n",
      "was thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of\n",
      "her happiness and her unhappiness. She was thinking, just when he came\n",
      "upon her, of this: why was it, she wondered, that to others, to Betsy\n",
      "(she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch) it was all easy,\n",
      "while to her it was such torture? Today this thought gained special\n",
      "poignancy from certain other considerations. She asked him about the\n",
      "races. He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated,\n",
      "trying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone the\n",
      "details of his preparations for the races.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell him or not tell him?\" she thought, looking into his quiet,\n",
      "affectionate eyes. \"He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he\n",
      "won't understand as he ought, he won't understand all the gravity of\n",
      "this fact to us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you haven't told me what you were thinking of when I came in,\" he\n",
      "said, interrupting his narrative; \"please tell me!\"\n",

      "She did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked\n",
      "inquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under their\n",
      "long lashes. Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked. He\n",
      "saw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish\n",
      "devotion, which had done so much to win her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see something has happened. Do you suppose I can be at peace, knowing\n",
      "you have a trouble I am not sharing? Tell me, for God's sake,\" he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I shan't be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the\n",

      "still staring at him in the same way, and feeling the hand that held the\n",
      "leaf was trembling more and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For God's sake!\" he repeated, taking her hand.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, yes . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm with child,\" she said, softly and deliberately. The leaf in her\n",
      "hand shook more violently, but she did not take her eyes off him,\n",
      "watching how he would take it. He turned white, would have said\n",
      "something, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and his head sank on his\n",
      "breast. \"Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it,\" she thought, and\n",
      "gratefully she pressed his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as\n",
      "she, a woman, realized it. On hearing it, he felt come upon him with\n",
      "tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone. But at\n",
      "the same time, he felt that the turning-point he had been longing for\n",
      "had come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her\n",
      "husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should\n",
      "soon put an end to their unnatural position. But, besides that, her\n",
      "emotion physically affected him in the same way. He looked at her with a\n",
      "look of submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in silence,\n",
      "paced up and down the terrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, going up to her resolutely. \"Neither you nor I have\n",

      "met his appeal now. It was as though there were something in this which\n",
      "she could not or would not face, as though directly she began to speak\n",
      "of this, she, the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and another\n",

      "power to prevent scandal. And he will calmly and punctually act in\n",
      "accordance with his words. That's what will happen. He's not a man, but\n",

      "the high road and walked, picking his way carefully through the mud, to\n",
      "his carriage. He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for Anna,\n",
      "that he did not even think what o'clock it was, and whether he had time\n",
      "to go to Bryansky's. He had left him, as often happens, only the\n",
      "external faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to take,\n",
      "one after the other. He went up to his coachman, who was dozing on the\n",
      "box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick limetree; he admired\n",
      "the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses, and, waking\n",

      "There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards' race,\n",
      "then the officers' mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile race, and\n",
      "then the race for which he was entered. He could still be in time for\n",
      "his race, but if he went to Bryansky's he could only just be in time,\n",
      "and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their\n",

      "so he decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare the horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached Bryansky's, spent five minutes there, and galloped back. This\n",
      "rapid drive calmed him. All that was painful in his relations with Anna,\n",

      "slipped out of his mind. He was thinking now with pleasure and\n",
      "excitement of the race, of his being anyhow, in time, and now and then\n",

      "across his imagination like a flaming light.\n",

      "sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and people on foot,\n",
      "soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions swarming with\n",
      "people. The second race was apparently going on, for just as he went\n",

      "brought Vronsky to a standstill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you won't recognize your friends! How are you, _mon cher?_\" said\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the\n",
      "Petersburg brilliance as he was in Moscow, his face rosy, and his\n",
      "whiskers sleek and glossy. \"I came up yesterday, and I'm delighted that\n",
      "I shall see your triumph. When shall we meet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come tomorrow to the messroom,\" said Vronsky, and squeezing him by the\n",
      "sleeve of his coat, with apologies, he moved away to the center of the\n",
      "race course, where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming\n",
      "and exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh\n",
      "horses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part\n",
      "English racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up\n",
      "bellies like strange, huge birds. On the right was led in Frou-Frou,\n",
      "lean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, rather long pasterns, as\n",
      "though moved by springs. Not far from her they were taking the rug off\n",
      "the lop-eared Gladiator. The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines\n",
      "of the stallion, with his superb hind-quarters and excessively short\n",
      "pasterns almost over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky's attention in spite\n",
      "of himself. He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again detained\n",
      "by an acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there's Karenin!\" said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting.\n",
      "\"He's looking for his wife, and she's in the middle of the pavilion.\n",
      "Didn't you see her?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round towards the\n",
      "pavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina, he went up\n",
      "to his mare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he had to\n",
      "give some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion\n",
      "to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting. Seventeen\n",
      "officers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met together\n",
      "in the pavilion and drew the numbers. Vronsky drew the number seven. The\n",
      "cry was heard: \"Mount!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling that with the others riding in the race, he was the center upon\n",
      "which all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his mare in that\n",
      "state of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and\n",
      "composed in his movements. Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his\n",
      "best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar, which\n",
      "propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots. He was calm and\n",
      "dignified as ever, and was with his own hands holding Frou-Frou by both\n",
      "reins, standing straight in front of her. Frou-Frou was still trembling\n",
      "as though in a fever. Her eye, full of fire, glanced sideways at\n",
      "Vronsky. Vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle-girth. The mare\n",
      "glanced aslant at him, drew up her lip, and twitched her ear. The\n",
      "Englishman puckered up his lips, intending to indicate a smile that\n",
      "anyone should verify his saddling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get up; you won't feel so excited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals. He knew that he\n",
      "would not see them during the race. Two were already riding forward to\n",
      "the point from which they were to start. Galtsin, a friend of Vronsky's\n",
      "and one of his more formidable rivals, was moving round a bay horse that\n",
      "would not let him mount. A little light hussar in tight riding breeches\n",
      "rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in imitation\n",
      "of English jockeys. Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his\n",
      "thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom led\n",
      "her by the bridle. Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and his\n",
      "peculiarity of \"weak nerves\" and terrible vanity. They knew that he was\n",
      "afraid of everything, afraid of riding a spirited horse. But now, just\n",
      "because it was terrible, because people broke their necks, and there was\n",
      "a doctor standing at each obstacle, and an ambulance with a cross on it,\n",
      "and a sister of mercy, he had made up his mind to take part in the race.\n",
      "Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod.\n",
      "Only one he did not see, his chief rival, Mahotin on Gladiator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't be in a hurry,\" said Cord to Vronsky, \"and remember one thing:\n",
      "don't hold her in at the fences, and don't urge her on; let her go as\n",
      "she likes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, all right,\" said Vronsky, taking the reins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you can, lead the race; but don't lose heart till the last minute,\n",
      "even if you're behind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile,\n",
      "vigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and firmly\n",
      "seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle. Getting his right\n",
      "foot in the stirrup, he smoothed the double reins, as he always did,\n",
      "between his fingers, and Cord let go.\n",
      "\n",
      "As though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started,\n",
      "dragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though she were on\n",
      "springs, shaking her rider from side to side. Cord quickened his step,\n",
      "following him. The excited mare, trying to shake off her rider first on\n",
      "one side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in\n",
      "vain with voice and hand to soothe her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the\n",
      "starting point. Several of the riders were in front and several behind,\n",
      "when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud\n",
      "behind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged,\n",
      "lop-eared Gladiator. Mahotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but Vronsky\n",
      "looked angrily at him. He did not like him, and regarded him now as his\n",
      "most formidable rival. He was angry with him for galloping past and\n",
      "exciting his mare. Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her left foot\n",
      "forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins, passed\n",
      "into a jolting trot, bumping her rider up and down. Cord, too, scowled,\n",
      "and followed Vronsky almost at a trot.\n",

      "There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race. The race\n",
      "course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of\n",
      "the pavilion. On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the\n",
      "stream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the\n",
      "pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an\n",
      "Irish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a\n",
      "mound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for\n",
      "the horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be\n",
      "killed); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and\n",
      "the end of the race was just facing the pavilion. But the race began not\n",
      "in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part of the\n",
      "course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in\n",
      "breadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse\n",
      "thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again. The umpire who\n",
      "was starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper,\n",
      "when at last for the fourth time he shouted \"Away!\" and the racers\n",
      "started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every eye, every opera glass, was turned on the brightly colored group\n",
      "of riders at the moment they were in line to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're off! They're starting!\" was heard on all sides after the hush\n",
      "of expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running\n",
      "from place to place to get a better view. In the very first minute the\n",
      "close group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were\n",
      "approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another. To the\n",
      "spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously, but\n",
      "to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and\n",
      "several horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream,\n",
      "Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at\n",
      "the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of him\n",
      "Mahotin's chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving lightly\n",
      "and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and in front\n",
      "of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his\n",
      "mare. Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the\n",
      "motions of his mare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same\n",
      "instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to\n",
      "the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the\n",
      "very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost\n",
      "under his mare's hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the\n",
      "further side of the stream. (Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took\n",
      "the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.) Those details\n",
      "Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just under him,\n",
      "where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana's legs or head might be in the way.\n",
      "But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping, like\n",
      "a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted beyond her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O the darling!\" thought Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and\n",
      "began holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind\n",
      "Mahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five\n",
      "hundred yards that followed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion. The Tsar\n",
      "and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them--at\n",
      "him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near the \"devil,\"\n",
      "as the solid barrier was called. Vronsky was aware of those eyes\n",
      "fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the ears and\n",
      "neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the back and\n",
      "white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and keeping\n",
      "always the same distance ahead. Gladiator rose, with no sound of\n",
      "knocking against anything. With a wave of his short tail he disappeared\n",
      "from Vronsky's sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bravo!\" cried a voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same instant, under Vronsky's eyes, right before him flashed the\n",
      "palings of the barrier. Without the slightest change in her action his\n",
      "mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a crash\n",
      "behind him. The mare, excited by Gladiator's keeping ahead, had risen\n",
      "too soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind hoofs. But her\n",
      "pace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face,\n",
      "realized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator. Once\n",
      "more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and\n",
      "again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to\n",
      "overtake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts, without\n",
      "any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and began\n",
      "getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to the\n",
      "inner cord. Mahotin would not let her pass that side. Vronsky had hardly\n",
      "formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side, when\n",
      "Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side.\n",
      "Frou-Frou's shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was even\n",
      "with Gladiator's back. For a few lengths they moved evenly. But before\n",
      "the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the reins,\n",
      "anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly passed\n",
      "Mahotin just upon the declivity. He caught a glimpse of his mud-stained\n",
      "face as he flashed by. He even fancied that he smiled. Vronsky passed\n",
      "Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon him, and he\n",
      "never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid and still\n",
      "quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily\n",
      "crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator\n",
      "closer upon him. He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she\n",
      "easily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator's hoofs was again\n",
      "heard at the same distance away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as Cord\n",
      "had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner. His excitement,\n",
      "his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener and keener. He\n",
      "longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this, and tried to be\n",
      "cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in\n",
      "her as he felt that Gladiator still kept. There remained only one\n",
      "obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it ahead of the others\n",
      "he would come in first. He was flying towards the Irish barricade,\n",
      "Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance, and\n",
      "both the man and the mare had a moment's hesitation. He saw the\n",
      "uncertainty in the mare's ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time\n",
      "felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted. She\n",
      "quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had fancied she would,\n",
      "and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush,\n",
      "which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the same rhythm,\n",
      "without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell back into her\n",
      "pace again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bravo, Vronsky!\" he heard shouts from a knot of men--he knew they were\n",
      "his friends in the regiment--who were standing at the obstacle. He could\n",
      "not fail to recognize Yashvin's voice though he did not see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O my sweet!\" he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened for what was\n",
      "happening behind. \"He's cleared it!\" he thought, catching the thud of\n",
      "Gladiator's hoofs behind him. There remained only the last ditch, filled\n",
      "with water and five feet wide. Vronsky did not even look at it, but\n",
      "anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins,\n",
      "lifting the mare's head and letting it go in time with her paces. He\n",
      "felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her\n",
      "neck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops\n",
      "on her mane, her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short,\n",
      "sharp gasps. But he knew that she had strength left more than enough for\n",
      "the remaining five hundred yards. It was only from feeling himself\n",
      "nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that\n",
      "Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace. She flew over\n",
      "the ditch as though not noticing it. She flew over it like a bird; but\n",
      "at the same instant Vronsky, to his horror, felt that he had failed to\n",
      "keep up with the mare's pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a\n",
      "fearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle. All\n",
      "at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had\n",
      "happened. He could not yet make out what had happened, when the white\n",
      "legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at\n",
      "a swift gallop. Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot, and his\n",
      "mare was sinking on that foot. He just had time to free his leg when she\n",
      "fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise\n",
      "with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the ground at his feet\n",
      "like a shot bird. The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her\n",
      "back. But that he only knew much later. At that moment he knew only that\n",
      "Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he stood staggering alone on the\n",
      "muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending\n",
      "her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes. Still unable to\n",
      "realize what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his mare's reins. Again she\n",
      "struggled all over like a fish, and her shoulders setting the saddle\n",
      "heaving, she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back, she\n",
      "quivered all over and again fell on her side. With a face hideous with\n",
      "passion, his lower jaw trembling, and his cheeks white, Vronsky kicked\n",
      "her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein.\n",
      "She did not stir, but thrusting her nose into the ground, she simply\n",
      "gazed at her master with her speaking eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A--a--a!\" groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head. \"Ah! what have I\n",
      "done!\" he cried. \"The race lost! And my fault! shameful, unpardonable!\n",

      "A crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of his\n",

      "unhurt. The mare had broken her back, and it was decided to shoot her.\n",
      "Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone. He\n",
      "turned, and without picking up his cap that had fallen off, walked away\n",
      "from the race course, not knowing where he was going. He felt utterly\n",
      "wretched. For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of\n",

      "\n",
      "Yashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There are two aspects,\" Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed: \"those who take\n",

      "and so he did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the\n",
      "spectators with his weary eyes. His eyes rested upon Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face was white and set. She was obviously seeing nothing and no one\n",
      "but one man. Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan, and she held\n",
      "her breath. He looked at her and hastily turned away, scrutinizing other\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But here's this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it's very\n",
      "natural,\" Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself. He tried not to look at\n",
      "her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her. He examined that face\n",
      "again, trying not to read what was so plainly written on it, and against\n",
      "his own will, with horror read on it what he did not want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first fall--Kuzovlev's, at the stream--agitated everyone, but Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna's pale, triumphant face that the\n",
      "man she was watching had not fallen. When, after Mahotin and Vronsky had\n",
      "cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown straight on\n",
      "his head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror passed over\n",
      "the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even\n",
      "notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking\n",
      "of about her. But more and more often, and with greater persistence, he\n",
      "watched her. Anna, wholly engrossed as she was with the race, became\n",
      "aware of her husband's cold eyes fixed upon her from one side.\n",
      "\n",
      "She glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, and with a\n",
      "slight frown turned away again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, I don't care!\" she seemed to say to him, and she did not once\n",
      "glance at him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in\n",
      "it more than half were thrown and hurt. Towards the end of the race\n",

      "the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the way\n",
      "in it. But afterwards a change came over Anna's face which really was\n",
      "beyond decorum. She utterly lost her head. She began fluttering like a\n",
      "caged bird, at one moment would have got up and moved away, at the next\n",

      "towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and\n",
      "there was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out\n",
      "nothing. She laid down the opera glass, and would have moved away, but\n",

      "drove out of the crowd of carriages. In spite of all he had seen, Alexey\n",

      "behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his duty to tell her so. But it\n",
      "was very difficult for him not to say more, to tell her nothing but\n",

      "determination, under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she\n",

      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even\n",
      "malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you. There was a time\n",
      "when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that now.\n",
      "Now I speak only of your external attitude. You have behaved improperly,\n",
      "and I would wish it not to occur again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken\n",
      "before him, and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not\n",
      "killed. Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was\n",
      "unhurt, but the horse had broken its back? She merely smiled with a\n",
      "pretense of irony when he finished, and made no reply, because she had\n",
      "not heard what he said. Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly,\n",
      "but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of, the dismay she was\n",
      "feeling infected him too. He saw the smile, and a strange\n",
      "misapprehension came over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is smiling at my suspicions. Yes, she will tell me directly what\n",
      "she told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that\n",
      "it's absurd.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him,\n",
      "there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly\n",
      "as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless. So\n",
      "terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe\n",
      "anything. But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy, did not now\n",
      "promise even deception.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possibly I was mistaken,\" said he. \"If so, I beg your pardon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you were not mistaken,\" she said deliberately, looking desperately\n",
      "into his cold face. \"You were not mistaken. I was, and I could not help\n",
      "being in despair. I hear you, but I am thinking of him. I love him, I am\n",
      "his mistress; I can't bear you; I'm afraid of you, and I hate you....\n",
      "You can do what you like to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she broke into sobs,\n",
      "hiding her face in her hands. Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and\n",
      "kept looking straight before him. But his whole face suddenly bore the\n",
      "solemn rigidity of the dead, and his expression did not change during\n",
      "the whole time of the drive home. On reaching the house he turned his\n",
      "head to her, still with the same expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well! But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of\n",
      "propriety till such time\"--his voice shook--\"as I may take measures to\n",
      "secure my honor and communicate them to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out first and helped her to get out. Before the servants he\n",
      "pressed her hand, took his seat in the carriage, and drove back to\n",
      "Petersburg. Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy\n",
      "and brought Anna a note.\n",
      "\n",

      "She glanced at her watch. She had still three hours to wait, and the\n",
      "memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.\n",

      "In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had\n",
      "betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered\n",
      "together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of\n",
      "society went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite and\n",
      "unalterable place. Just as the particle of water in frost, definitely\n",
      "and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of snow, so each\n",

      "There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German Fuerstin,\n",
      "in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more\n",
      "vigorously than ever. Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything,\n",
      "to present her daughter to this German princess, and the day after their\n",
      "arrival she duly performed this rite. Kitty made a low and graceful\n",
      "curtsey in the _very simple_, that is to say, very elegant frock that\n",
      "had been ordered her from Paris. The German princess said, \"I hope the\n",
      "roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,\" and for the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid\n",
      "down from which there was no departing. The Shtcherbatskys made the\n",
      "acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and of a\n",
      "German countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a learned\n",
      "Swede, and of M. Canut and his sister. But yet inevitably the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya\n",
      "Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because\n",
      "she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a Moscow\n",
      "colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform\n",
      "and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and\n",
      "flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there\n",
      "was no getting rid of him. When all this was so firmly established,\n",
      "Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to\n",
      "Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother. She took no interest in\n",
      "the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them. Her\n",
      "chief mental interest in the watering-place consisted in watching and\n",
      "making theories about the people she did not know. It was characteristic\n",
      "of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most\n",
      "favorable light possible, especially so in those she did not know. And\n",
      "now as she made surmises as to who people were, what were their\n",
      "relations to one another, and what they were like, Kitty endowed them\n",
      "with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of\n",
      "her idea in her observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who\n",
      "had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame\n",
      "Stahl, as everyone called her. Madame Stahl belonged to the highest\n",
      "society, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on\n",
      "exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid\n",
      "carriage. But it was not so much from ill-health as from pride--so\n",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it--that Madame Stahl had not made\n",
      "the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there. The Russian girl\n",
      "looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as Kitty observed,\n",
      "on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and\n",
      "there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the\n",
      "most natural way. This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered, related\n",
      "to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant. Madame Stahl called her\n",
      "Varenka, and other people called her \"Mademoiselle Varenka.\" Apart from\n",
      "the interest Kitty took in this girl's relations with Madame Stahl and\n",
      "with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often happened, felt an\n",
      "inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, and was aware when\n",
      "their eyes met that she too liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first\n",
      "youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might have\n",
      "been taken for nineteen or for thirty. If her features were criticized\n",
      "separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly\n",
      "hue of her face. She would have been a good figure, too, if it had not\n",
      "been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head, which was too\n",
      "large for her medium height. But she was not likely to be attractive to\n",
      "men. She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without\n",
      "fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered. Moreover, she would\n",
      "have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had\n",
      "too much of--of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness\n",
      "of her own attractiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,\n",
      "and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it. It\n",
      "was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the\n",
      "great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka. Kitty felt that in her, in her\n",
      "manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so\n",
      "painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life--apart from the\n",
      "worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and\n",
      "appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a\n",
      "purchaser. The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the\n",
      "more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied\n",
      "her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they met,\n",
      "Kitty's eyes said: \"Who are you? What are you? Are you really the\n",
      "exquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for goodness' sake don't\n",
      "suppose,\" her eyes added, \"that I would force my acquaintance on you, I\n",
      "simply admire you and like you.\" \"I like you too, and you're very, very\n",
      "sweet. And I should like you better still, if I had time,\" answered the\n",
      "eyes of the unknown girl. Kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.\n",
      "Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the\n",
      "springs, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in it,\n",
      "or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying\n",
      "cakes for tea for someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the\n",
      "morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and\n",
      "unfavorable attention. These were a tall man with a stooping figure, and\n",
      "huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and\n",
      "yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and\n",
      "tastelessly dressed. Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty had\n",
      "already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching\n",
      "romance about them. But the princess, having ascertained from the\n",

      "Madame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband\n",
      "out of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched\n",
      "by his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and\n",
      "enthusiastic temperament. When, after her separation from her husband,\n",
      "she gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost immediately,\n",
      "and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility, and fearing the\n",
      "news would kill her, had substituted another child, a baby born the same\n",
      "night and in the same house in Petersburg, the daughter of the chief\n",
      "cook of the Imperial Household. This was Varenka. Madame Stahl learned\n",
      "later on that Varenka was not her own child, but she went on bringing\n",
      "her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of\n",
      "her own living. Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years\n",
      "continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch. And some\n",
      "people said that Madame Stahl had made her social position as a\n",
      "philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she really was\n",
      "at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but the good of\n",
      "her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to be. No one knew\n",
      "what her faith was--Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox. But one fact was\n",
      "indubitable--she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries\n",
      "of all the churches and sects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew\n",

      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to\n",
      "in her daughter's intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka's\n",
      "breeding and education were of the best--she spoke French and English\n",
      "extremely well--and what was of the most weight, brought a message from\n",
      "Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill\n",
      "health from making the acquaintance of the princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by\n",

      "\"Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it's true, but you\n",
      "will give us so much pleasure,\" said the princess with her affected\n",

      "that Varenka had no inclination to sing. Varenka came, however, in the\n",
      "evening and brought a roll of music with her. The princess had invited\n",
      "Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did\n",
      "not know, and she went directly to the piano. She could not accompany\n",

      "well, accompanied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have an extraordinary talent,\" the princess said to her after\n",

      "admiration.\n",

      "by their praises. She seemed only to be asking: \"Am I to sing again, or\n",
      "is that enough?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it had been I,\" thought Kitty, \"how proud I should have been! How\n",
      "delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows! But\n",
      "she's utterly unmoved by it. Her only motive is to avoid refusing and to\n",
      "please mamma. What is there in her? What is it gives her the power to\n",
      "look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything? How I\n",
      "should like to know it and to learn it of her!\" thought Kitty, gazing\n",
      "into her serene face. The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and\n",
      "Varenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing\n",
      "erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin, dark-skinned\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next song in the book was an Italian one. Kitty played the opening\n",
      "bars, and looked round at Varenka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's skip that,\" said Varenka, flushing a little. Kitty let her eyes\n",
      "rest on Varenka's face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, the next one,\" she said hurriedly, turning over the pages,\n",
      "and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, \"no,\n",
      "let's have that one.\" And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as\n",
      "well as the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.\n",
      "Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the\n",
      "house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?\"\n",
      "said Kitty. \"Don't tell me,\" she added hastily, \"only say if I'm right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, why not? I'll tell you simply,\" said Varenka, and, without waiting\n",
      "for a reply, she went on: \"Yes, it brings up memories, once painful\n",
      "ones. I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at\n",
      "Varenka.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,\n",
      "and he married another girl. He's living now not far from us, and I see\n",
      "him sometimes. You didn't think I had a love story too,\" she said, and\n",
      "there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty\n",
      "felt must once have glowed all over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think so? Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone\n",
      "else after knowing you. Only I can't understand how he could, to please\n",
      "his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, he's a very good man, and I'm not unhappy; quite the contrary,\n",
      "I'm very happy. Well, so we shan't be singing any more now,\" she added,\n",
      "turning towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How good you are! how good you are!\" cried Kitty, and stopping her, she\n",
      "kissed her. \"If I could only be even a little like you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why should you be like anyone? You're nice as you are,\" said Varenka,\n",
      "smiling her gentle, weary smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm not nice at all. Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let's sit\n",
      "down,\" said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her. \"Tell me, isn't\n",
      "it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he\n",
      "hasn't cared for it?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But he didn't disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a\n",
      "dutiful son...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but if it hadn't been on account of his mother, if it had been his\n",
      "own doing?...\" said Kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret, and\n",
      "that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her\n",
      "already.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted\n",
      "him,\" answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking\n",
      "not of her, but of Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the humiliation,\" said Kitty, \"the humiliation one can never\n",
      "forget, can never forget,\" she said, remembering her look at the last\n",
      "ball during the pause in the music.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where is the humiliation? Why, you did nothing wrong?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Worse than wrong--shameful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what is there shameful?\" she said. \"You didn't tell a man, who\n",
      "didn't care for you, that you loved him, did you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it. No, no, there are\n",
      "looks, there are ways; I can't forget it, if I live a hundred years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why so? I don't understand. The whole point is whether you love him now\n",
      "or not,\" said Varenka, who called everything by its name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate him; I can't forgive myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The shame, the humiliation!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!\" said Varenka. \"There\n",
      "isn't a girl who hasn't been through the same. And it's all so\n",
      "unimportant.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what is important?\" said Kitty, looking into her face with\n",
      "inquisitive wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there's so much that's important,\" said Varenka, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, so much that's more important,\" answered Varenka, not knowing what\n",

      "window. \"Kitty, it's cold! Either get a shawl, or come indoors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It really is time to go in!\" said Varenka, getting up. \"I have to go on\n",

      "gives you such tranquillity? You know, tell me!\" But Varenka did not\n",
      "even know what Kitty's eyes were asking her. She merely thought that she\n",
      "had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste home\n",
      "in time for _maman's_ tea at twelve o'clock. She went indoors, collected\n",

      "one's youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows\n",
      "nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of\n",
      "Christ's compassion for us no sorrow is trifling--and immediately talked\n",
      "of other things. But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every word, in\n",
      "every heavenly--as Kitty called it--look, and above all in the whole\n",
      "story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized that\n",
      "something \"that was important,\" of which, till then, she had known\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl's character was, touching as was her\n",
      "story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help\n",
      "detecting in her some traits which perplexed her. She noticed that when\n",
      "questioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled\n",
      "contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness. She\n",
      "noticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her, Madame\n",
      "Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and\n",
      "had smiled in a peculiar way. Trivial as these two observations were,\n",
      "they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl. But on\n",
      "the other hand Varenka, alone in the world, without friends or\n",
      "relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring\n",
      "nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which Kitty\n",
      "dared hardly dream. In Varenka she realized that one has but to forget\n",
      "oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble. And\n",
      "that was what Kitty longed to be. Seeing now clearly what was _the most\n",
      "important_, Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she\n",
      "at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was\n",
      "opening to her. From Varenka's accounts of the doings of Madame Stahl\n",
      "and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had already constructed the\n",
      "plan of her own future life. She would, like Madame Stahl's niece,\n",
      "Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great deal, seek out those\n",
      "who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, help them as far as\n",
      "she could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to the sick, to\n",
      "criminals, to the dying. The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as\n",
      "Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty. But all these were secret\n",
      "dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or to Varenka.\n",
      "\n",
      "While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,\n",
      "however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many\n",
      "people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new\n",
      "principles in imitation of Varenka.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the\n",
      "influence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for Madame Stahl, and\n",
      "still more for Varenka. She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate\n",
      "Varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of\n",
      "walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes. But later on the princess\n",
      "noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual\n",
      "change was taking place in her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that\n",
      "Madame Stahl had given her--a thing she had never done before; that she\n",
      "avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who\n",
      "were under Varenka's protection, and especially one poor family, that of\n",
      "a sick painter, Petrov. Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part\n",
      "of a sister of mercy in that family. All this was well enough, and the\n",
      "princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov's wife was\n",
      "a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess, noticing\n",
      "Kitty's devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of consolation. All\n",
      "this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration. But\n",
      "the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes, and so\n",
      "indeed she told her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_,\" she said to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one\n",
      "could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned. What\n",
      "exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one\n",
      "was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give one's\n",
      "cloak if one's coat were taken? But the princess disliked this\n",
      "exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter\n",
      "did not care to show her all her heart. Kitty did in fact conceal her\n",
      "new views and feelings from her mother. She concealed them not because\n",
      "she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply because she\n",
      "was her mother. She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to\n",
      "her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it Anna Pavlovna's not been to see us for so long?\" the princess\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I've not noticed it, maman,\" said Kitty, flushing hotly.\n",

      "\"Is it long since you went to see them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can go,\" answered the princess, gazing at her daughter's\n",
      "embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had\n",
      "changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow. And the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Kitty, haven't you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?\" said\n",
      "the princess, when they were left alone. \"Why has she given up sending\n",
      "the children and coming to see us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she\n",
      "could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her. Kitty\n",
      "answered perfectly truly. She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had\n",
      "changed to her, but she guessed it. She guessed at something which she\n",
      "could not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.\n",
      "It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak\n",
      "of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the\n",
      "family. She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round,\n",
      "good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered\n",
      "their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him\n",
      "away from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him out-of-doors;\n",
      "the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her \"my Kitty,\" and\n",
      "would not go to bed without her. How nice it all was! Then she recalled\n",
      "the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his long neck, in his\n",
      "brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were\n",
      "so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem hearty\n",
      "and lively in her presence. She recalled the efforts she had made at\n",
      "first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him, as for all\n",
      "consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to think of things to\n",
      "say to him. She recalled the timid, softened look with which he gazed at\n",
      "her, and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness, and later of\n",
      "a sense of her own goodness, which she had felt at it. How nice it all\n",
      "was! But all that was at first. Now, a few days ago, everything was\n",
      "suddenly spoiled. Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality,\n",
      "and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause\n",
      "of Anna Pavlovna's coolness?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she mused, \"there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna,\n",
      "and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day before\n",
      "yesterday: 'There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn't drink his\n",
      "coffee without you, though he's grown so dreadfully weak.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, perhaps, too, she didn't like it when I gave him the rug. It was\n",
      "all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking me,\n",
      "that I felt awkward too. And then that portrait of me he did so well.\n",
      "And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness! Yes, yes, that's\n",
      "it!\" Kitty repeated to herself with horror. \"No, it can't be, it\n",
      "oughtn't to be! He's so much to be pitied!\" she said to herself directly\n",

      "to his wife and daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were\n",
      "completely opposed. The princess thought everything delightful, and in\n",
      "spite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad\n",
      "to be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not--for the\n",
      "simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she was\n",
      "affected, which did not altogether suit her. The prince, on the\n",
      "contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European\n",

      "abroad less European than he was in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his\n",
      "cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind. His good humor was even\n",

      "friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports the princess\n",
      "gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty, troubled the\n",
      "prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that\n",
      "drew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might\n",
      "have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to\n",
      "him. But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of\n",

      "waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good. But the nearer\n",
      "they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their\n",
      "appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions\n",
      "of prosperous German life. Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.\n",
      "The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the\n",
      "music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with\n",
      "their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she\n",

      "fashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants, seemed\n",
      "something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these slowly\n",

      "delighted to see the old Frenchwoman's face light up when she heard\n",

      "\n",
      "Varenka made--simply and naturally as she did everything--a movement\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course I know you; I know you very well,\" the prince said to her\n",

      "\n",

      "\"So that's angel number one?\" said the prince when Varenka had gone on.\n",

      "could not do it because he liked her.\n",

      "\"Come, so we shall see all your friends,\" he went on, \"even Madame\n",
      "Stahl, if she deigns to recognize me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, did you know her, papa?\" Kitty asked apprehensively, catching the\n",
      "gleam of irony that kindled in the prince's eyes at the mention of\n",
      "Madame Stahl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she'd joined\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't quite know myself. I only know that she thanks God for\n",
      "everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her husband\n",
      "died. And that's rather droll, as they didn't get on together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that? What a piteous face!\" he asked, noticing a sick man of\n",
      "medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white\n",
      "trousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs. This\n",
      "man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and high\n",
      "forehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's Petrov, an artist,\" answered Kitty, blushing. \"And that's his\n",
      "wife,\" she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose,\n",
      "at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had\n",
      "run off along a path.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Poor fellow! and what a nice face he has!\" said the prince. \"Why don't\n",
      "you go up to him? He wanted to speak to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, let us go, then,\" said Kitty, turning round resolutely. \"How are\n",

      "\n",
      "Petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.\n",

      "The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white\n",
      "teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We expected you yesterday, princess,\" he said to Kitty. He staggered as\n",
      "he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if\n",
      "it had been intentional.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you were\n",
      "not going.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not going!\" said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough,\n",
      "and his eyes sought his wife. \"Anita! Anita!\" he said loudly, and the\n",
      "swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna Pavlovna came up.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, princess,\" said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed smile\n",
      "utterly unlike her former manner. \"Very glad to make your acquaintance,\"\n",
      "she said to the prince. \"You've long been expected, prince.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What did you send word to the princess that we weren't going for?\" the\n",
      "artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously\n",
      "exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his\n",
      "words the expression he would have liked to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, mercy on us! I thought we weren't going,\" his wife answered\n",
      "crossly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, when....\" He coughed and waved his hand. The prince took off his\n",
      "hat and moved away with his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah! ah!\" he sighed deeply. \"Oh, poor things!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, papa,\" answered Kitty. \"And you must know they've three children,\n",
      "no servant, and scarcely any means. He gets something from the Academy,\"\n",
      "she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the queer change\n",
      "in Anna Pavlovna's manner to her had aroused in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, here's Madame Stahl,\" said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage,\n",
      "where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a\n",
      "sunshade. This was Madame Stahl. Behind her stood the gloomy,\n",
      "healthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage. Close by was\n",
      "standing a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name. Several\n",
      "invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the lady as\n",
      "though she were some curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince went up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam\n",
      "of irony in his eyes. He went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her with\n",
      "extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so few\n",
      "speak nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you\n",
      "for your kindness to my daughter,\" he said, taking off his hat and not\n",
      "putting it on again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,\" said Madame Stahl, lifting upon him\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are still in weak health?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; I'm used to it,\" said Madame Stahl, and she introduced the prince\n",
      "to the Swedish count.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are scarcely changed at all,\" the prince said to her. \"It's ten or\n",
      "eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. Often one\n",
      "wonders what is the goal of this life?... The other side!\" she said\n",
      "angrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her\n",
      "satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To do good, probably,\" said the prince with a twinkle in his eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is not for us to judge,\" said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade\n",
      "of expression on the prince's face. \"So you will send me that book, dear\n",
      "count? I'm very grateful to you,\" she said to the young Swede.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing\n",
      "near, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his daughter\n",
      "and the Moscow colonel, who joined them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's our aristocracy, prince!\" the Moscow colonel said with ironical\n",

      "uncomfortable with his brother in the country. It made him\n",

      "Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a\n",
      "valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with\n",
      "satisfaction and a sense of its utility. To Konstantin Levin the country\n",
      "was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the usefulness\n",
      "of which there could be no doubt. To Sergey Ivanovitch the country was\n",
      "particularly good, because there it was possible and fitting to do\n",
      "nothing. Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch's attitude to the peasants rather\n",
      "piqued Konstantin. Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he knew and liked\n",
      "the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants, which he knew how to\n",
      "do without affectation or condescension, and from every such\n",
      "conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the\n",
      "peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them. Konstantin Levin did\n",
      "not like such an attitude to the peasants. To Konstantin the peasant was\n",
      "simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in spite of all the\n",
      "respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he had for the\n",
      "peasant--sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the milk of his\n",
      "peasant nurse--still as a fellow-worker with him, while sometimes\n",
      "enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these men, he\n",
      "was very often, when their common labors called for other qualities,\n",
      "exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of method,\n",
      "drunkenness, and lying. If he had been asked whether he liked or didn't\n",
      "like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss\n",
      "what to reply. He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked\n",
      "and did not like men in general. Of course, being a good-hearted man, he\n",
      "liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants.\n",
      "But like or dislike \"the people\" as something apart he could not, not\n",
      "only because he lived with \"the people,\" and all his interests were\n",
      "bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of\n",
      "\"the people,\" did not see any special qualities or failings\n",
      "distinguishing himself and \"the people,\" and could not contrast himself\n",
      "with them. Moreover, although he had lived so long in the closest\n",
      "relations with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and what was\n",
      "more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him, and for thirty miles round\n",
      "they would come to ask his advice), he had no definite views of \"the\n",
      "people,\" and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question\n",
      "whether he knew \"the people\" as the question whether he liked them. For\n",
      "him to say he knew the peasantry would have been the same as to say he\n",
      "knew men. He was continually watching and getting to know people of all\n",
      "sorts, and among them peasants, whom he regarded as good and interesting\n",
      "people, and he was continually observing new points in them, altering\n",
      "his former views of them and forming new ones. With Sergey Ivanovitch it\n",
      "was quite the contrary. Just as he liked and praised a country life in\n",
      "comparison with the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry\n",
      "in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he\n",
      "knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men\n",
      "generally. In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated\n",
      "certain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself,\n",

      "\"But why can't you? I must own I can't make it out. Indifference,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"None of those things. I've tried, and I see I can do nothing,\" said\n",

      "\"Self-respect!\" said Levin, stung to the quick by his brother's words;\n",
      "\"I don't understand. If they'd told me at college that other people\n",
      "understood the integral calculus, and I didn't, then pride would have\n",
      "come in. But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has\n",
      "certain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that\n",
      "all this business is of great importance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! do you mean to say it's not of importance?\" said Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, stung to the quick too at his brother's considering anything\n",
      "of no importance that interested him, and still more at his obviously\n",
      "paying little attention to what he was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can't help\n",
      "it,\" answered Levin, making out that what he saw was the bailiff, and\n",
      "that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed\n",
      "land. They were turning the plough over. \"Can they have finished\n",
      "ploughing?\" he wondered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, really though,\" said the elder brother, with a frown on his\n",
      "handsome, clever face, \"there's a limit to everything. It's very well to\n",
      "be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional--I know\n",
      "all about that; but really, what you're saying either has no meaning, or\n",
      "it has a very wrong meaning. How can you think it a matter of no\n",
      "importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never did assert it,\" thought Konstantin Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"... dies without help? The ignorant peasant-women starve the children,\n",
      "and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of\n",
      "every village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping\n",
      "them, and don't help them because to your mind it's of no importance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so\n",
      "undeveloped that you can't see all that you can do, or you won't\n",
      "sacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to\n",
      "submit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good. And this\n",
      "mortified him and hurt his feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's both,\" he said resolutely: \"I don't see that it was possible...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to\n",
      "provide medical aid?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square miles\n",
      "of our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in\n",
      "the fields, I don't see how it is possible to provide medical aid all\n",
      "over. And besides, I don't believe in medicine.\"\n",

      "\"Why have schools?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "everyone.\"\n",

      "indifference to public business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about\n",
      "establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools\n",
      "to which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants\n",
      "don't want to send their children, and to which I've no very firm faith\n",
      "that they ought to send them?\" said he.\n",

      "the subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack. He was silent\n",
      "for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his\n",
      "brother smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, now.... In the first place, the dispensary is needed. We\n",
      "ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and write\n",
      "is as a workman of more use and value to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you can ask anyone you like,\" Konstantin Levin answered with\n",
      "decision, \"the man that can read and write is much inferior as a\n",
      "workman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as\n",
      "they put up bridges they're stolen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still, that's not the point,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning. He\n",
      "disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually\n",
      "skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected\n",
      "points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply. \"Do you admit\n",
      "that education is a benefit for the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I admit it,\" said Levin without thinking, and he was conscious\n",
      "immediately that he had said what he did not think. He felt that if he\n",
      "admitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless\n",
      "rubbish. How it would be proved he could not tell, but he knew that this\n",
      "would inevitably be logically proved to him, and he awaited the proofs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you admit that it is a benefit,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, \"then, as\n",
      "an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the\n",
      "movement, and so wishing to work for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I still do not admit this movement to be just,\" said Konstantin\n",
      "Levin, reddening a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! But you said just now...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's to say, I don't admit it's being either good or possible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you can't tell without making the trial.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, supposing that's so,\" said Levin, though he did not suppose so at\n",
      "all, \"supposing that is so, still I don't see, all the same, what I'm to\n",
      "worry myself about it for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical point\n",
      "of view,\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't see where philosophy comes in,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a\n",
      "tone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother's right to\n",
      "talk about philosophy. And that irritated Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you, then,\" he said with heat, \"I imagine the mainspring of\n",
      "all our actions is, after all, self-interest. Now in the local\n",
      "institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my\n",
      "prosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my\n",
      "horses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and dispensaries are\n",
      "no use to me. An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me. I never appeal\n",
      "to him, and never shall appeal to him. The schools are no good to me,\n",
      "but positively harmful, as I told you. For me the district institutions\n",
      "simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three\n",
      "acres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts\n",
      "of idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no inducement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile, \"self-interest\n",
      "did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did\n",
      "work for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!\" Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; \"the\n",
      "emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There self-interest\n",
      "did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all\n",
      "decent people among us. But to be a town councilor and discuss how many\n",
      "dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in\n",
      "which I don't live--to serve on a jury and try a peasant who's stolen a\n",
      "flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of\n",
      "jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the\n",
      "president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, 'Do you admit,\n",
      "prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?' 'Eh?'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the\n",
      "president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all\n",
      "to the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what do you mean to say, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest, I\n",
      "shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made raids\n",
      "on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to defend\n",
      "those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and\n",
      "freedom. I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my\n",
      "children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what\n",
      "concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of\n",
      "district council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka--I don't\n",
      "understand, and I can't do it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst\n",
      "open. Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But tomorrow it'll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to be tried. I shan't murder anybody, and I've no need of\n",
      "it. Well, I tell you what,\" he went on, flying off again to a subject\n",
      "quite beside the point, \"our district self-government and all the rest\n",
      "of it--it's just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on\n",
      "Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up of\n",
      "itself in Europe, and I can't gush over these birch branches and believe\n",
      "in them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express\n",
      "his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that\n",
      "point, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, but you know one really can't argue in that way,\" he\n",
      "observed.\n",

      "weariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be\n",
      "able to keep it up: he was so tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his\n",
      "strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop. But at that\n",
      "very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up\n",
      "some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it. Levin straightened\n",
      "himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round. Behind him came a\n",
      "peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at once without\n",
      "waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe. Tit sharpened\n",
      "his scythe and Levin's, and they went on. The next time it was just the\n",
      "same. Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe, not stopping\n",
      "nor showing signs of weariness. Levin followed him, trying not to get\n",
      "left behind, and he found it harder and harder: the moment came when he\n",
      "felt he had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit stopped and\n",
      "whetted the scythes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So they mowed the first row. And this long row seemed particularly hard\n",
      "work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his\n",
      "scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his\n",
      "heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over the\n",
      "space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his\n",
      "face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as though he\n",
      "had been soaked in water, he felt very happy. What delighted him\n",
      "particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.\n",
      "\n",
      "His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut. \"I will\n",
      "swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,\" he thought,\n",
      "comparing Tit's row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line,\n",
      "with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly,\n",
      "probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to\n",
      "be a long one. The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain\n",
      "every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind the\n",
      "peasants, and to do his work as well as possible. He heard nothing but\n",
      "the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit's upright figure mowing\n",
      "away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and flower\n",
      "heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe,\n",
      "and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was or\n",
      "whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot, moist\n",
      "shoulders. He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the\n",
      "scythes. A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops\n",
      "were falling. Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;\n",
      "others--just like Levin himself--merely shrugged their shoulders,\n",
      "enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another row, and yet another row, followed--long rows and short rows,\n",
      "with good grass and with poor grass. Levin lost all sense of time, and\n",
      "could not have told whether it was late or early now. A change began to\n",
      "come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction. In the midst of\n",
      "his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing,\n",
      "and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row was\n",
      "almost as smooth and well cut as Tit's. But so soon as he recollected\n",
      "what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at once\n",
      "conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly mown.\n",
      "\n",
      "On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the\n",
      "meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the old\n",
      "man said something in a low voice to him. They both looked at the sun.\n",
      "\"What are they talking about, and why doesn't he go back?\" thought\n",

      "to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.\n",

      "now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had only\n",
      "been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the first\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet turned\n",

      "which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one's arms in\n",
      "walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the high, even row of\n",
      "grass. It was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself\n",

      "\n",

      "Levin kept between them. In the very heat of the day the mowing did not\n",
      "seem such hard work to him. The perspiration with which he was drenched\n",
      "cooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his arms,\n",
      "bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor; and more\n",
      "and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when it was\n",
      "possible not to think what one was doing. The scythe cut of itself.\n",
      "These were happy moments. Still more delightful were the moments when\n",
      "they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old man rubbed his\n",
      "scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What do you say to my home-brew, eh? Good, eh?\" said he, winking.\n",
      "\n",
      "And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water\n",
      "with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper.\n",
      "And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter, with his\n",
      "hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat,\n",
      "take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long string of mowers\n",
      "and at what was happening around in the forest and the country.\n",

      "of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work\n",
      "turned out regular and well-finished of itself. These were the most\n",
      "blissful moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had\n",
      "become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or\n",
      "a tuft of sorrel. The old man did this easily. When a hillock came he\n",
      "changed his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with\n",
      "the tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short\n",
      "strokes. And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what\n",
      "came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or\n",
      "offered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the\n",
      "scythe, then he looked at a quail's nest, from which the bird flew just\n",
      "under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting\n",
      "it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it\n",
      "away.\n",
      "\n",
      "For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of\n",
      "position were difficult. Both of them, repeating over and over again the\n",
      "same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were\n",
      "incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what\n",
      "was before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin did not notice how time was passing. If he had been asked how long\n",
      "he had been working he would have said half an hour--and it was getting\n",
      "on for dinner time. As they were walking back over the cut grass, the\n",
      "old man called Levin's attention to the little girls and boys who were\n",
      "coming from different directions, hardly visible through the long grass,\n",
      "and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks of bread dragging\n",
      "at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer, with cloths\n",
      "wrapped round them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look'ee, the little emmets crawling!\" he said, pointing to them, and he\n",
      "shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun. They mowed two more\n",
      "rows; the old man stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, master, dinner time!\" he said briskly. And on reaching the stream\n",
      "the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of\n",
      "coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting\n",
      "waiting for them. The peasants gathered into groups--those further away\n",
      "under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago. The peasants\n",
      "got ready for dinner. Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream,\n",
      "others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of bread,\n",
      "and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer. The old man crumbled up some\n",
      "bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured water on\n",
      "it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having seasoned it\n",
      "with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, master, taste my sop,\" said he, kneeling down before the cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home. He dined\n",
      "with the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking the\n",
      "keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and all the\n",
      "circumstances that could be of interest to the old man. He felt much\n",
      "nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at the\n",
      "affection he felt for this man. When the old man got up again, said his\n",
      "prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his head for\n",
      "a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging flies that\n",
      "were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled his hot\n",
      "face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had\n",
      "passed to the other side of the bush and reached him. The old man had\n",
      "been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the\n",
      "younger lads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was\n",
      "so changed. The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was\n",
      "sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already\n",
      "sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun. And the\n",
      "bushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not\n",
      "visible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving,\n",
      "ascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of\n",
      "the meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow--all was\n",
      "perfectly new. Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had\n",
      "been cut and how much more could still be done that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men. They had cut the\n",
      "whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor, taken\n",
      "thirty scythes two days to mow. Only the corners remained to do, where\n",
      "the rows were short. But Levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done\n",
      "that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in\n",
      "the sky. He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his work done\n",
      "more and more quickly and as much done as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?--what do you think?\" he said to the\n",
      "old man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As God wills, the sun's not high. A little vodka for the lads?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who\n",
      "smoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that \"Mashkin\n",
      "Upland's to be cut--there'll be some vodka.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not cut it? Come on, Tit! We'll look sharp! We can eat at night.\n",
      "Come on!\" cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back\n",
      "to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, lads, keep it up!\" said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get along, get along!\" said the old man, hurrying after him and easily\n",
      "overtaking him, \"I'll mow you down, look out!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one\n",
      "another. But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass, and\n",
      "the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly. The little piece left\n",
      "uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes. The last of the mowers\n",
      "were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats\n",
      "onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin Upland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their\n",
      "jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland. The grass was\n",
      "up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and\n",
      "feathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild heart's-ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a brief consultation--whether to take the rows lengthwise or\n",
      "diagonally--Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired\n",
      "peasant, went on ahead. He went up to the top, turned back again and\n",
      "started mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind him, going\n",
      "downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the\n",
      "forest. The sun sank behind the forest. The dew was falling by now; the\n",
      "mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a mist was\n",
      "rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh, dewy shade.\n",
      "The work went rapidly. The grass cut with a juicy sound, and was at once\n",
      "laid in high, fragrant rows. The mowers from all sides, brought closer\n",
      "together in the short row, kept urging one another on to the sound of\n",
      "jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the whetstones\n",
      "sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man. The old man,\n",
      "who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as good-humored,\n",
      "jocose, and free in his movements. Among the trees they were continually\n",
      "cutting with their scythes the so-called \"birch mushrooms,\" swollen fat\n",
      "in the succulent grass. But the old man bent down every time he came\n",
      "across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in his bosom. \"Another\n",
      "present for my old woman,\" he said as he did so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up and\n",
      "down the steep sides of the ravine. But this did not trouble the old\n",
      "man. Swinging his scythe just as ever, and moving his feet in their big,\n",
      "plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he climbed slowly up the steep\n",
      "place, and though his breeches hanging out below his smock, and his\n",
      "whole frame trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of grass or\n",
      "one mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and\n",
      "Levin. Levin walked after him and often thought he must fall, as he\n",
      "climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard\n",
      "work to clamber without anything. But he climbed up and did what he had\n",
      "to do. He felt as though some external force were moving him.\n",

      "their coats and were gaily trudging home. Levin got on his horse and,\n",
      "parting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards. On the hillside\n",
      "he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from\n",

      "Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room. Although it\n",
      "seemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner simply\n",
      "so as not to hurt Kouzma's feelings, yet when he began to eat the dinner\n",
      "struck him as extraordinarily good. Sergey Ivanovitch watched him with a\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, by the way, there's a letter for you,\" said he. \"Kouzma, bring it\n",
      "down, please. And mind you shut the doors.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter was from Oblonsky. Levin read it aloud. Oblonsky wrote to him\n",

      "and everything seems going wrong there. Do ride over and see her,\n",
      "please; help her with advice; you know all about it. She will be so glad\n",
      "to see you. She's quite alone, poor thing. My mother-in-law and all of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's capital! I will certainly ride over to her,\" said Levin. \"Or\n",

      "humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you have an appetite!\" he said, looking at his dark-red, sunburnt\n",
      "face and neck bent over the plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid! You can't imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing to look at\n",
      "you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the forest.\n",
      "I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village, met your\n",
      "old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants' view of you. As far as I\n",
      "can make out, they don't approve of this. She said: 'It's not a\n",
      "gentleman's work.' Altogether, I fancy that in the people's ideas there\n",
      "are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it,\n",
      "'gentlemanly' lines of action. And they don't sanction the gentry's\n",
      "moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe so; but anyway it's a pleasure such as I have never known in my\n",
      "life. And there's no harm in it, you know. Is there?\" answered Levin. \"I\n",
      "can't help it if they don't like it. Though I do believe it's all right.\n",
      "Eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Altogether,\" pursued Sergey Ivanovitch, \"you're satisfied with your\n",
      "day?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And such a splendid old man I\n",
      "made friends with there! You can't fancy how delightful he was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, so you're content with your day. And so am I. First, I solved two\n",
      "chess problems, and one a very pretty one--a pawn opening. I'll show it\n",
      "you. And then--I thought over our conversation yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eh! our conversation yesterday?\" said Levin, blissfully dropping his\n",
      "eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner, and\n",
      "absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts to\n",
      "this, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that\n",
      "interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain\n",
      "degree of advancement. Possibly you are right too, that action founded\n",
      "on material interest would be more desirable. You are altogether, as the\n",
      "French say, too _primesautiere_ a nature; you must have intense,\n",
      "energetic action, or nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word, and\n",
      "did not want to understand. He was only afraid his brother might ask him\n",
      "some question which would make it evident he had not heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So that's what I think it is, my dear boy,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch,\n",
      "touching him on the shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won't stand up for my view,\"\n",
      "answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile. \"Whatever was it I was\n",
      "disputing about?\" he wondered. \"Of course, I'm right, and he's right,\n",
      "and it's all first-rate. Only I must go round to the counting house and\n",
      "see to things.\" He got up, stretching and smiling. Sergey Ivanovitch\n",
      "smiled too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you want to go out, let's go together,\" he said, disinclined to be\n",
      "parted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness\n",

      "there.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"What, what is the matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How's Agafea Mihalovna's hand?\" said Levin, slapping himself on the\n",

      "\"It's much better.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Stephan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural\n",
      "and essential official duty--so familiar to everyone in the government\n",
      "service, though incomprehensible to outsiders--that duty, but for which\n",
      "one could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of\n",
      "his existence--and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken\n",
      "all the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his\n",
      "days at the races and in the summer villas. Meanwhile Dolly and the\n",
      "children had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as\n",
      "possible. She had gone to Ergushovo, the estate that had been her dowry,\n",
      "and the one where in spring the forest had been sold. It was nearly\n",
      "forty miles from Levin's Pokrovskoe. The big, old house at Ergushovo had\n",
      "been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the lodge done up\n",
      "and built on to. Twenty years before, when Dolly was a child, the lodge\n",
      "had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all lodges, it stood\n",
      "sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south. But by now this\n",
      "lodge was old and dilapidated. When Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down in\n",
      "the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to look over the\n",
      "house and order what repairs might be needed. Stepan Arkadyevitch, like\n",
      "all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his wife's\n",
      "comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and given\n",
      "instructions about everything that he considered necessary. What he\n",

      "In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch's efforts to be an attentive father and\n",

      "that he shaped his life. On his return to Moscow he informed his wife\n",
      "with pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little\n",
      "paradise, and that he advised her most certainly to go. His wife's\n",
      "staying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch\n",
      "from every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased\n",
      "expenses, and it left him more at liberty. Darya Alexandrovna regarded\n",

      "feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience\n",
      "towards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often\n",
      "and miserably punished. Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the\n",
      "cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of children\n",
      "recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be\n",
      "disguised. Whatever faults Levin had, there was not a trace of hypocrisy\n",
      "in him, and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they\n",

      "I'll give directions about their food. Everything depends on their\n",
      "food.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "He talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and,\n",

      "\n",

      "She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged,\n",

      "production of milk, she looked on with suspicion. It seemed to her that\n",

      "always clear whom you love. But a girl's in a position of suspense, with\n",
      "all a woman's or maiden's modesty, a girl who sees you men from afar,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, pride, pride!\" said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising him for\n",
      "the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which\n",
      "only women know. \"At the time when you made Kitty an offer she was just\n",
      "in a position in which she could not answer. She was in doubt. Doubt\n",
      "between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing every day, and you she had\n",
      "not seen for a long while. Supposing she had been older ... I, for\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my\n",

      "nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know!\" said Levin, jumping up. \"If you only knew how you are\n",

      "say to you: He would have been like this and like that, and he might\n",
      "have lived, and how happy you would have been in him. But he's dead,\n",
      "dead, dead!...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How absurd you are!\" said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful\n",
      "tenderness at Levin's excitement. \"Yes, I see it all more and more\n",

      "Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything in Darya Alexandrovna's house and children struck him now as\n",
      "by no means so charming as a little while before. \"And what does she\n",

      "it is! And the children feel it so: Learning French and unlearning\n",
      "sincerity,\" he thought to himself, unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had\n",
      "thought all that over twenty times already, and yet, even at the cost of\n",
      "some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to teach her children\n",
      "French in that way.\n",

      "and, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed,\n",
      "with a troubled face, and tears in her eyes. While Levin had been\n",
      "outside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the\n",
      "happiness she had been feeling that day, and her pride in her children.\n",
      "Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball. Darya Alexandrovna,\n",
      "hearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight. Tanya\n",
      "was pulling Grisha's hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was\n",
      "beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her. Something\n",
      "snapped in Darya Alexandrovna's heart when she saw this. It was as if\n",
      "darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children of\n",
      "hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but\n",
      "positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal\n",
      "propensities--wicked children.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak to\n",
      "Levin of her misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it\n",
      "showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it, he\n",

      "In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin's sister's\n",
      "estate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on\n",
      "how things were going there and on the hay. The chief source of income\n",
      "on his sister's estate was from the riverside meadows. In former years\n",
      "the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three\n",
      "acres. When Levin took over the management of the estate, he thought on\n",
      "examining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the\n",
      "price at twenty-five roubles the three acres. The peasants would not\n",
      "give that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.\n",
      "Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut,\n",
      "partly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of\n",
      "the crop. His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of\n",
      "this new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the\n",
      "meadows had yielded a profit almost double. The previous year--which was\n",
      "the third year--the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the\n",
      "arrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system. This year the\n",
      "peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the\n",
      "village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and\n",
      "that, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had\n",
      "divided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks\n",
      "as the owner's share. From the vague answers to his question how much\n",
      "hay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village\n",
      "elder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone\n",
      "of the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the\n",

      "Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the cottage\n",
      "of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother's wet-nurse, Levin\n",

      "the truth about the hay. Parmenitch, a talkative, comely old man, gave\n",
      "Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was doing, told him\n",
      "everything about his bees and the swarms of that year; but gave vague\n",
      "and unwilling answers to Levin's inquiries about the mowing. This\n",
      "confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions. He went to the hay fields\n",
      "and examined the stacks. The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty\n",
      "wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons\n",
      "that had carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack,\n",
      "and carry it into the barn. There turned out to be only thirty-two loads\n",
      "in the stack. In spite of the village elder's assertions about the\n",
      "compressibility of hay, and its having settled down in the stacks, and\n",
      "his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God, Levin\n",
      "stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders, and\n",
      "that, therefore, he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack.\n",
      "After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking\n",
      "these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each. The arguments\n",
      "and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon. When the\n",
      "last of the hay had been divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence\n",
      "of the rest to the counting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked\n",
      "off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming\n",

      "In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a\n",

      "rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble. After\n",
      "the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there\n",
      "were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks. To the left, carts were\n",
      "rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one after\n",
      "another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in their\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What weather for haying! What hay it'll be!\" said an old man, squatting\n",

      "haycocks. \"Since dinnertime they've carried a good half of it.\"\n",

      "huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to\n",
      "him, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork. The young wife\n",
      "worked easily, merrily, and dexterously. The close-packed hay did not\n",
      "once break away off her fork. First she gathered it together, stuck the\n",
      "fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight\n",
      "of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the red\n",
      "belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the white\n",
      "smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the\n",

      "her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his arms to\n",
      "clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart. As she raked together what was\n",

      "conscious. But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to\n",
      "effect this transition from the old life to the new. And there nothing\n",
      "took clear shape for him. \"Have a wife? Have work and the necessity of\n",
      "work? Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member of a peasant\n",
      "community? Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about it?\" he asked\n",
      "himself again, and could not find an answer. \"I haven't slept all night,\n",
      "though, and I can't think it out clearly,\" he said to himself. \"I'll\n",
      "work it out later. One thing's certain, this night has decided my fate.\n",
      "All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing,\" he told\n",
      "himself. \"It's all ever so much simpler and better...\"\n",

      "head in the middle of the sky. \"How exquisite it all is in this\n",
      "exquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?\n",

      "harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road on which\n",
      "he was walking. The shaft-horses were tilted against the shafts by the\n",

      "the empty fields all round, the village in front, and he himself\n",
      "isolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted\n",
      "highroad.\n",

      "He glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he had\n",
      "been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that\n",

      "the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been accomplished.\n",
      "There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over fully half the\n",
      "sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets. The sky had grown\n",
      "blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the same\n",

      "others. A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of me. My aim\n",
      "is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for the\n",
      "uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.\" Official duties, which had\n",
      "always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch's eyes, seemed\n",
      "of special importance to his mind at this moment. Considering and\n",
      "rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce--another\n",
      "solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered. Passing in\n",
      "mental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty\n",
      "of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar),\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the\n",
      "object of divorce was that which he had in view. In all these instances\n",
      "the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife, and the\n",
      "very party which, being in fault, had not the right to contract a fresh\n",
      "marriage, had formed counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a\n",
      "self-styled husband. In his own case, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a\n",
      "legal divorce, that is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would\n",
      "be repudiated, was impossible of attainment. He saw that the complex\n",
      "conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife's\n",
      "guilt, required by the law, out of the question; he saw that a certain\n",
      "refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought\n",
      "forward, even if he had them, and that to bring forward such proofs\n",
      "would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which\n",
      "would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his\n",
      "high position in society. His chief object, to define the position with\n",
      "the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by\n",
      "divorce either. Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an attempt\n",
      "to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all\n",
      "relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover. And in\n",
      "spite of the complete, as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now\n",
      "felt for his wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch\n",
      "still had one feeling left in regard to her--a disinclination to see her\n",
      "free to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would be to her\n",
      "advantage. The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey Alexandrovitch,\n",
      "that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony, and got\n",
      "up and changed his place in the carriage, and for a long while after, he\n",
      "sat with scowling brows, wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy\n",
      "rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov, Paskudin,\n",
      "and that good fellow Dram--that is, separate from one's wife,\" he went\n",
      "on thinking, when he had regained his composure. But this step too\n",
      "presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce, and what was\n",
      "more, a separation, quite as much as a regular divorce, flung his wife\n",
      "into the arms of Vronsky. \"No, it's out of the question, out of the\n",
      "question!\" he said again, twisting his rug about him again. \"I cannot be\n",
      "unhappy, but neither she nor he ought to be happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period of\n",
      "uncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with\n",
      "agony extracted by his wife's words. But that feeling had been replaced\n",
      "by another, the desire, not merely that she should not be triumphant,\n",
      "but that she should get due punishment for her crime. He did not\n",
      "acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his heart he longed for\n",
      "her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind--his honor. And\n",
      "going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel, a divorce,\n",
      "a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey Alexandrovitch felt\n",
      "convinced that there was only one solution,--to keep her with him,\n",
      "concealing what had happened from the world, and using every measure in\n",
      "his power to break off the intrigue, and still more--though this he did\n",
      "not admit to himself--to punish her. \"I must inform her of my\n",
      "conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position in which she has\n",
      "placed her family, all other solutions will be worse for both sides than\n",
      "an external _status quo_, and that such I agree to retain, on the strict\n",
      "condition of obedience on her part to my wishes, that is to say,\n",
      "cessation of all intercourse with her lover.\" When this decision had\n",
      "been finally adopted, another weighty consideration occurred to Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch in support of it. \"By such a course only shall I be\n",
      "acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,\" he told himself.\n",
      "\"In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty wife, but giving\n",
      "her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as the task will be to\n",
      "me, I shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and\n",
      "salvation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert\n",
      "any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at reformation\n",
      "could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing through these\n",
      "difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in\n",
      "religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to\n",
      "him, with the requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his\n",
      "decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his\n",
      "peace of mind. He was pleased to think that, even in such an important\n",
      "crisis in life, no one would be able to say that he had not acted in\n",
      "accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had\n",
      "always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference. As he\n",
      "pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey Alexandrovitch did not\n",
      "see, indeed, why his relations with his wife should not remain\n",
      "practically the same as before. No doubt, she could never regain his\n",
      "esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any sort of reason\n",
      "that his existence should be troubled, and that he should suffer because\n",
      "she was a bad and faithless wife. \"Yes, time will pass; time, which\n",
      "arranges all things, and the old relations will be reestablished,\"\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself; \"so far reestablished, that is, that\n",

      "complication that had arisen in his official life, which at the time\n",
      "constituted the chief interest of it. He felt that he had penetrated\n",
      "more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair, and that he had\n",
      "originated a leading idea--he could say it without\n",
      "self-flattery--calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen\n",
      "him in his official career, to discomfit his enemies, and thereby to be\n",
      "of the greatest benefit to the government. Directly the servant had set\n",

      "papers, with a scarcely perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he took\n",
      "a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report\n",
      "relating to the present complication. The complication was of this\n",
      "nature: Alexey Alexandrovitch's characteristic quality as a politician,\n",
      "that special individual qualification that every rising functionary\n",
      "possesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his\n",

      "was his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his\n",
      "direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his\n",
      "economy. It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had\n",
      "set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky\n",
      "province, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch's department, and was a\n",
      "glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms. Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this. The irrigation of these\n",
      "lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch's predecessor. And vast sums of money had actually\n",
      "been spent and were still being spent on this business, and utterly\n",
      "unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing\n",
      "whatever. Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on entering\n",
      "office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of Irrigation.\n",
      "But at first, when he did not yet feel secure in his position, he knew\n",
      "it would affect too many interests, and would be injudicious. Later on\n",
      "he had been engrossed in other questions, and had simply forgotten the\n",
      "Board of Irrigation. It went of itself, like all such boards, by the\n",
      "mere force of inertia. (Many people gained their livelihood by the Board\n",
      "of Irrigation, especially one highly conscientious and musical family:\n",
      "all the daughters played on stringed instruments, and Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the\n",

      "was in Alexey Alexandrovitch's opinion a dishonorable proceeding, seeing\n",
      "that in every department there were things similar and worse, which no\n",
      "one inquired into, for well-known reasons of official etiquette.\n",
      "However, now that the glove had been thrown down to him, he had boldly\n",
      "picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to\n",
      "investigate and verify the working of the Board of Irrigation of the\n",
      "lands in the Zaraisky province. But in compensation he gave no quarter\n",
      "to the enemy either. He demanded the appointment of another special\n",

      "of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes.\n",
      "In the commission this question had been a ground of contention between\n",
      "several departments. The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch\n",
      "proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly\n",
      "flourishing, that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their\n",

      "the failure on the part of Alexey Alexandrovitch's department to carry\n",

      "(4) ethnographical, (5) material, and (6) religious points of view;\n",

      "before, suddenly struck her now as not only not simple, but as\n",
      "absolutely hopeless. She felt terrified at the disgrace, of which she\n",
      "had not ever thought before. Directly she thought of what her husband\n",
      "would do, the most terrible ideas came to her mind. She had a vision of\n",

      "to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband, and had\n",
      "continually repeated in her imagination, she had said to everyone, and\n",
      "everyone had heard them. She could not bring herself to look those of\n",

      "which she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the\n",
      "plight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from\n",
      "her relation to her husband or to Vronsky. This support was her son. In\n",
      "whatever position she might be placed, she could not lose her son. Her\n",

      "so that he might not be taken from her. Quickly indeed, as quickly as\n",
      "possible, she must take action before he was taken from her. She must\n",
      "take her son and go away. Here was the one thing she had to do now. She\n",
      "needed consolation. She must be calm, and get out of this insufferable\n",
      "position. The thought of immediate action binding her to her son, of\n",
      "going away somewhere with him, gave her this consolation.\n",

      "Another letter had to be written to Vronsky. \"I have told my husband,\"\n",

      "at the end. \"Preparations shall be made for your arrival here ... I\n",
      "attach particular significance to compliance...\" she read. She ran on,\n",
      "then back, read it all through, and once more read the letter all\n",
      "through again from the beginning. When she had finished, she felt that\n",
      "she was cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as she had not\n",
      "expected, had burst upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband, and\n",
      "wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken. And\n",
      "here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her what she had\n",
      "wanted. But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she\n",
      "had been able to conceive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's right!\" she said; \"of course, he's always right; he's a Christian,\n",
      "he's generous! Yes, vile, base creature! And no one understands it\n",
      "except me, and no one ever will; and I can't explain it. They say he's\n",
      "so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever; but they don't\n",

      "years, crushed everything that was living in me--he has not once even\n",
      "thought that I'm a live woman who must have love. They don't know how at\n",
      "every step he's humiliated me, and been just as pleased with himself.\n",
      "Haven't I striven, striven with all my strength, to find something to\n",
      "give meaning to my life? Haven't I struggled to love him, to love my son\n",
      "when I could not love my husband? But the time came when I knew that I\n",
      "couldn't cheat myself any longer, that I was alive, that I was not to\n",
      "blame, that God has made me so that I must love and live. And now what\n",
      "does he do? If he'd killed me, if he'd killed him, I could have borne\n",
      "anything, I could have forgiven anything; but, no, he.... How was it I\n",
      "didn't guess what he would do? He's doing just what's characteristic of\n",
      "his mean character. He'll keep himself in the right, while me, in my\n",
      "ruin, he'll drive still lower to worse ruin yet....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She recalled the words from the letter. \"You can conjecture what awaits\n",
      "you and your son....\" \"That's a threat to take away my child, and most\n",
      "likely by their stupid law he can. But I know very well why he says it.\n",
      "He doesn't believe even in my love for my child, or he despises it (just\n",
      "as he always used to ridicule it). He despises that feeling in me, but\n",
      "he knows that I won't abandon my child, that I can't abandon my child,\n",
      "that there could be no life for me without my child, even with him whom\n",
      "I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from him, I should\n",

      "knows that I am incapable of doing that.\"\n",

      "that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to go on\n",
      "torturing me. I know him; I know that he's at home and is happy in\n",
      "deceit, like a fish swimming in the water. No, I won't give him that\n",

      "jumping up and keeping back her tears. And she went to the writing table\n",
      "to write him another letter. But at the bottom of her heart she felt\n",
      "that she was not strong enough to break through anything, that she was\n",
      "not strong enough to get out of her old position, however false and\n",
      "dishonorable it might be.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down at the writing table, but instead of writing she clasped\n",
      "her hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, burst into tears,\n",
      "with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying. She was weeping that\n",
      "her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been\n",
      "annihilated forever. She knew beforehand that everything would go on in\n",
      "the old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way. She felt that\n",
      "the position in the world that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to her\n",
      "of so little consequence in the morning, that this position was precious\n",
      "to her, that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the\n",
      "shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join\n",
      "her lover; that however much she might struggle, she could not be\n",
      "stronger than herself. She would never know freedom in love, but would\n",
      "remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of detection hanging over\n",
      "her at every instant; deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful\n",
      "connection with a man living apart and away from her, whose life she\n",
      "could never share. She knew that this was how it would be, and at the\n",
      "same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would\n",
      "end in. And she cried without restraint, as children cry when they are\n",
      "punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound of the footman's steps forced her to rouse herself, and,\n",
      "hiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing.\n",

      "\"The courier asks if there's an answer,\" the footman announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"An answer? Yes,\" said Anna. \"Let him wait. I'll ring.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "I know? What do I want? What is there I care for?\" Again she felt that\n",
      "her soul was beginning to be split in two. She was terrified again at\n",
      "this feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing something\n",
      "which might divert her thoughts from herself. \"I ought to see Alexey\"\n",
      "(so she called Vronsky in her thoughts); \"no one but he can tell me what\n",

      "said to herself, completely forgetting that when she had told him the\n",
      "day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya's, he had said\n",
      "that in that case he should not go either. She went up to the table,\n",
      "wrote to her husband, \"I have received your letter.--A.\"; and, ringing\n",

      "\n",
      "The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was\n",
      "to consist of two ladies and their adorers. These two ladies were the\n",
      "chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in\n",
      "imitation of some imitation, _les sept merveilles du monde_. These\n",
      "ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was\n",
      "utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved. Moreover, Stremov, one of\n",
      "the most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of\n",
      "Liza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch's enemy in the political\n",
      "world. From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the\n",
      "hints in Princess Tverskaya's note referred to her refusal. But now Anna\n",
      "was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya's earlier than the other guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same moment as she entered, Vronsky's footman, with side-whiskers\n",
      "combed out like a _Kammerjunker_, went in too. He stopped at the door,\n",
      "and, taking off his cap, let her pass. Anna recognized him, and only\n",
      "then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before that he would not\n",
      "come. Most likely he was sending a note to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman,\n",
      "pronouncing his \"r's\" even like a _Kammerjunker_, say, \"From the count\n",
      "for the princess,\" and hand the note.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to question him as to where his master was. She longed to\n",
      "turn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself to\n",
      "see him. But neither the first nor the second nor the third course was\n",
      "possible. Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival ahead\n",
      "of her, and Princess Tverskaya's footman was standing at the open door\n",
      "waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately. Would\n",
      "you be pleased to walk into the garden?\" announced another footman in\n",
      "another room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at\n",
      "home--worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step,\n",
      "impossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among outsiders,\n",
      "in company so uncongenial to her present mood. But she was wearing a\n",
      "dress that she knew suited her. She was not alone; all around was that\n",
      "luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to, and she felt less\n",
      "wretched than at home. She was not forced to think what she was to do.\n",
      "Everything would be done of itself. On meeting Betsy coming towards her\n",
      "in a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her just\n",
      "as she always did. Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch and a\n",
      "young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents in the\n",
      "provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I slept badly,\" answered Anna, looking intently at the footman who came\n",
      "to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought Vronsky's note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How glad I am you've come!\" said Betsy. \"I'm tired, and was just\n",
      "longing to have some tea before they come. You might go\"--she turned to\n",
      "Tushkevitch--\"with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where\n",
      "they've been cutting it. We shall have time to talk a little over tea;\n",
      "we'll have a cozy chat, eh?\" she said in English to Anna, with a smile,\n",
      "pressing the hand with which she held a parasol.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, especially as I can't stay very long with you. I'm forced to go on\n",
      "to old Madame Vrede. I've been promising to go for a century,\" said\n",
      "Anna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her nature, had become not\n",
      "merely simple and natural in society, but a positive source of\n",
      "satisfaction. Why she said this, which she had not thought of a second\n",
      "before, she could not have explained. She had said it simply from the\n",
      "reflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she had better secure her\n",
      "own freedom, and try to see him somehow. But why she had spoken of old\n",
      "Madame Vrede, whom she had to go and see, as she had to see many other\n",
      "people, she could not have explained; and yet, as it afterwards turned\n",
      "out, had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky, she\n",
      "could have thought of nothing better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No. I'm not going to let you go for anything,\" answered Betsy, looking\n",
      "intently into Anna's face. \"Really, if I were not fond of you, I should\n",
      "feel offended. One would think you were afraid my society would\n",
      "compromise you. Tea in the little dining room, please,\" she said, half\n",
      "closing her eyes, as she always did when addressing the footman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking the note from him, she read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexey's playing us false,\" she said in French; \"he writes that he\n",
      "can't come,\" she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it\n",
      "could never enter her head that Vronsky could mean anything more to Anna\n",
      "than a game of croquet. Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but,\n",
      "hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her, she almost felt persuaded\n",
      "for a minute that she knew nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the\n",
      "matter, and she went on smiling: \"How can you or your friends compromise\n",
      "anyone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great\n",
      "fascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women. And it was not\n",
      "the necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment was\n",
      "contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't be more Catholic than the Pope,\" she said. \"Stremov and Liza\n",
      "Merkalova, why, they're the cream of the cream of society. Besides,\n",
      "they're received everywhere, and _I_\"--she laid special stress on the\n",
      "I--\"have never been strict and intolerant. It's simply that I haven't\n",
      "the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; you don't care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? Let him and Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee--that's no affair of\n",
      "ours. But in the world, he's the most amiable man I know, and a devoted\n",
      "croquet player. You shall see. And, in spite of his absurd position as\n",
      "Liza's lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off\n",
      "the absurd position. He's very nice. Sappho Shtoltz you don't know? Oh,\n",
      "that's a new type, quite new.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her good-humored,\n",
      "shrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight, and was\n",
      "hatching something for her benefit. They were in the little boudoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must write to Alexey though,\" and Betsy sat down to the table,\n",
      "scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm telling him to come to dinner. I've one lady extra to dinner with\n",
      "me, and no man to take her in. Look what I've said, will that persuade\n",
      "him? Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute. Would you seal it up,\n",
      "please, and send it off?\" she said from the door; \"I have to give some\n",

      "\n",
      "Without a moment's thought, Anna sat down to the table with Betsy's\n",
      "letter, and, without reading it, wrote below: \"It's essential for me to\n",
      "see you. Come to the Vrede garden. I shall be there at six o'clock.\" She\n",
      "sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in her presence handed the note to\n",
      "be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "At tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little\n",
      "drawing room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the\n",
      "arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women. They\n",
      "criticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell\n",
      "upon Liza Merkalova.\n",

      "\"She's very sweet, and I always liked her,\" said Anna.\n",
      "\n",

      "sorts of mad things for your sake. Stremov says she does that as it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do tell me, please, I never could make it out,\" said Anna, after\n",

      "asking an idle question, but that what she was asking was of more\n",
      "importance to her than it should have been; \"do tell me, please, what\n",
      "are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as he's called? I've\n",
      "met them so little. What does it mean?\"\n",

      "Betsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a new manner,\" she said. \"They've all adopted that manner. They've\n",
      "flung their caps over the windmills. But there are ways and ways of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; you laugh,\" said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself, \"but I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The husband? Liza Merkalova's husband carries her shawl, and is always\n",
      "ready to be of use. But anything more than that in reality, no one cares\n",

      "she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea. Putting\n",
      "a cup before Anna, she took out a cigarette, and, fitting it into a\n",
      "silver holder, she lighted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's like this, you see: I'm in a fortunate position,\" she began, quite\n",

      "and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman. It is true that her tone was\n",
      "the same as Sappho's; that like Sappho, she had two men, one young and\n",
      "one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their eyes. But there\n",

      "in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes. The weary, and at the same time\n",
      "passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by dark rings, impressed one\n",
      "by its perfect sincerity. Everyone looking into those eyes fancied he\n",

      "cordial with her, the wife of his enemy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Nothing,'\" he put in with a subtle smile, \"that's the very best way. I\n",
      "told you long ago,\" he said, turning to Liza Merkalova, \"that if you\n",
      "don't want to be bored, you mustn't think you're going to be bored. It's\n",
      "just as you mustn't be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if\n",

      "again to Anna. As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but\n",
      "commonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was\n",
      "returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of\n",
      "her, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole\n",

      "Anna was going. Stremov joined in her entreaties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's too violent a transition,\" he said, \"to go from such company to\n",

      "In spite of Vronsky's apparently frivolous life in society, he was a man\n",
      "who hated irregularity. In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he had\n",
      "experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being in\n",
      "difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put\n",

      "exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never supposes that\n",
      "others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal\n",
      "affairs as he is. So indeed it seemed to Vronsky. And not without inward\n",
      "pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other man would long\n",
      "ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some\n",
      "dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult\n",
      "position. But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him\n",
      "to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into\n",
      "difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary\n",
      "position. Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed,\n",
      "he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen\n",
      "thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the sake of\n",
      "clearness. Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found that he\n",
      "had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in\n",
      "before the New Year. Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky\n",
      "copied it, dividing it into three classes. In the first class he put the\n",
      "debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in any\n",
      "case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not\n",
      "be a moment's delay in paying. Such debts amounted to about four\n",
      "thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five\n",
      "hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum\n",
      "to a cardsharper in Vronsky's presence. Vronsky had wanted to pay the\n",
      "money at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and Yashvin\n",
      "had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.\n",
      "That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business,\n",
      "though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be\n",
      "surety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two\n",
      "thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the\n",
      "swindler, and have no more words with him. And so for this first and\n",
      "most important division he must have four thousand roubles. The second\n",
      "class--eight thousand roubles--consisted of less important debts. These\n",
      "were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses, to\n",
      "the purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on. He would\n",
      "have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to be\n",
      "quite free from anxiety. The last class of debts--to shops, to hotels,\n",
      "to his tailor--were such as need not be considered. So that he needed at\n",
      "least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he only had one\n",
      "thousand eight hundred. For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of\n",
      "revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky's income, such debts,\n",
      "one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the fact was that\n",
      "he was far from having one hundred thousand. His father's immense\n",
      "property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand,\n",
      "was left undivided between the brothers. At the time when the elder\n",
      "brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova, the\n",
      "daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had given\n",
      "up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father's\n",
      "estate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.\n",
      "Alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be\n",
      "sufficient for him until he married, which he probably never would do.\n",
      "And his brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive\n",
      "regiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift. His\n",
      "mother, who had her own separate property, had allowed Alexey every year\n",
      "twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had reserved,\n",
      "and Alexey had spent it all. Of late his mother, incensed with him on\n",
      "account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow, had given up sending\n",
      "him the money. And in consequence of this, Vronsky, who had been in the\n",
      "habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand a year, having only\n",
      "received twenty thousand that year, found himself now in difficulties.\n",
      "To get out of these difficulties, he could not apply to his mother for\n",
      "money. Her last letter, which he had received the day before, had\n",
      "particularly exasperated him by the hints in it that she was quite ready\n",
      "to help him to succeed in the world and in the army, but not to lead a\n",
      "life which was a scandal to all good society. His mother's attempt to\n",
      "buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever to\n",
      "her. But he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once\n",
      "uttered, even though he felt now, vaguely foreseeing certain\n",
      "eventualities in his intrigue with Madame Karenina, that this generous\n",
      "word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and that even though he were not\n",
      "married he might need all the hundred thousand of income. But it was\n",
      "impossible to draw back. He had only to recall his brother's wife, to\n",
      "remember how that sweet, delightful Varya sought, at every convenient\n",
      "opportunity, to remind him that she remembered his generosity and\n",
      "appreciated it, to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift. It\n",
      "was as impossible as beating a woman, stealing, or lying. One thing only\n",
      "could and ought to be done, and Vronsky determined upon it without an\n",
      "instant's hesitation: to borrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand\n",
      "roubles, a proceeding which presented no difficulty, to cut down his\n",
      "expenses generally, and to sell his race horses. Resolving on this, he\n",
      "promptly wrote a note to Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him\n",
      "with offers to buy horses from him. Then he sent for the Englishman and\n",
      "the money-lender, and divided what money he had according to the\n",
      "accounts he intended to pay. Having finished this business, he wrote a\n",
      "cold and cutting answer to his mother. Then he took out of his notebook\n",
      "three notes of Anna's, read them again, burned them, and remembering\n",

      "a hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect a\n",
      "woman could look for.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attitude to society, too, was clear. Everyone might know, might\n",
      "suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it. If any did so, he was\n",
      "ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the\n",
      "non-existent honor of the woman he loved.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all. From the moment\n",
      "that Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the\n",
      "one thing unassailable. Her husband was simply a superfluous and\n",
      "tiresome person. No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could\n",
      "that be helped? The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand\n",

      "this at any minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which\n",
      "frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness. Only the day before she had\n",
      "told him that she was with child. And he felt that this fact and what\n",
      "she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code\n",
      "of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life. And\n",
      "he had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she\n",
      "spoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to\n",
      "leave her husband. He had said that, but now thinking things over he saw\n",
      "clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the same\n",

      "robust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful\n",
      "creature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their\n",
      "softness and nobility than their beauty. The only change Vronsky\n",
      "detected in him was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content\n",
      "which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the\n",

      "bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the\n",
      "superiority of Russia over Poland, especially in cavalry attack, and\n",
      "there was a lull in the revelry for a moment. Serpuhovskoy went into the\n",
      "house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there; Vronsky\n",

      "sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and his head with\n",
      "his hands. When he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy. They\n",
      "both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a conversation began\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've always been hearing about you through my wife,\" said Serpuhovskoy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"She's friendly with Varya, and they're the only women in Petersburg I\n",

      "foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The only ones?\" Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,\" said\n",
      "Vronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of face. \"I was greatly\n",
      "delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised. I expected\n",
      "even more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Serpuhovskoy smiled. Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to\n",
      "him, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I on the contrary expected less--I'll own frankly. But I'm glad,\n",
      "very glad. I'm ambitious; that's my weakness, and I confess to it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps you wouldn't confess to it if you hadn't been successful,\" said\n",
      "Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose so,\" said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again. \"I won't say\n",
      "life wouldn't be worth living without it, but it would be dull. Of\n",
      "course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the\n",
      "line I've chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to\n",
      "be, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone. I used to think so\n",
      "too, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There it's out! here it comes!\" said Serpuhovskoy, laughing. \"Ever\n",
      "since I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I\n",
      "approved of what you did. But there are ways of doing everything. And I\n",
      "think your action was good in itself, but you didn't do it quite in the\n",
      "way you ought to have done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's done can't be undone, and you know I never go back on what I've\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Very well off--for the time. But you're not satisfied with that. I\n",
      "wouldn't say this to your brother. He's a nice child, like our host\n",
      "here. There he goes!\" he added, listening to the roar of \"hurrah!\"--\"and\n",
      "he's happy, but that does not satisfy you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't say it did satisfy me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but that's not the only thing. Such men as you are wanted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By whom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By whom? By society, by Russia. Russia needs men; she needs a party, or\n",
      "else everything goes and will go to the dogs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you mean? Bertenev's party against the Russian communists?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of\n",
      "such an absurdity. \"_Tout ca est une blague_. That's always been and\n",
      "always will be. There are no communists. But intriguing people have to\n",
      "invent a noxious, dangerous party. It's an old trick. No, what's wanted\n",
      "is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why so?\" Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power. \"Why aren't\n",
      "they independent men?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an\n",
      "independent fortune; they've not had a name, they've not been close to\n",
      "the sun and center as we have. They can be bought either by money or by\n",
      "favor. And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a\n",
      "policy. And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don't\n",
      "believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means\n",
      "to a government house and so much income. _Cela n'est pas plus fin que\n",
      "ca_, when you get a peep at their cards. I may be inferior to them,\n",
      "stupider perhaps, though I don't see why I should be inferior to them.\n",
      "But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in\n",
      "being more difficult to buy. And such men are more needed than ever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the\n",
      "meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already\n",
      "contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his\n",
      "likes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the\n",
      "governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment. Vronsky\n",
      "felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his\n",
      "unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in,\n",
      "through his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the\n",
      "world in which he moved. And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt\n",
      "envious.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still I haven't the one thing of most importance for that,\" he\n",
      "answered; \"I haven't the desire for power. I had it once, but it's\n",
      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me, that's not true,\" said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!\" Vronsky added, to be truthful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's true now, that's another thing; but that _now_ won't last\n",
      "forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps,\" answered Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say _perhaps_,\" Serpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his\n",
      "thoughts, \"but I say _for certain_. And that's what I wanted to see you\n",
      "for. Your action was just what it should have been. I see that, but you\n",
      "ought not to keep it up. I only ask you to give me carte blanche. I'm\n",
      "not going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn't I\n",
      "protect you?--you've protected me often enough! I should hope our\n",
      "friendship rises above all that sort of thing. Yes,\" he said, smiling to\n",
      "him as tenderly as a woman, \"give me _carte blanche_, retire from the\n",
      "regiment, and I'll draw you upwards imperceptibly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you must understand that I want nothing,\" said Vronsky, \"except\n",
      "that all should be as it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say that all should be as it is. I understand what that means. But\n",
      "listen: we're the same age, you've known a greater number of women\n",
      "perhaps than I have.\" Serpohovskoy's smile and gestures told Vronsky\n",
      "that he mustn't be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in\n",
      "touching the sore place. \"But I'm married, and believe me, in getting to\n",
      "know thoroughly one's wife, if one loves her, as someone has said, one\n",
      "gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're coming directly!\" Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into\n",
      "the room and called them to the colonel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey\n",
      "would say to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And here's my opinion for you. Women are the chief stumbling block in a\n",
      "man's career. It's hard to love a woman and do anything. There's only\n",
      "one way of having love conveniently without its being a\n",
      "hindrance--that's marriage. How, how am I to tell you what I mean?\" said\n",
      "Serpuhovskoy, who liked similes. \"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Yes,\n",
      "just as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your hands,\n",
      "when the fardeau is tied on your back, and that's marriage. And that's\n",
      "what I felt when I was married. My hands were suddenly set free. But to\n",
      "drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your hands will\n",
      "always be so full that you can do nothing. Look at Mazankov, at Krupov.\n",
      "They've ruined their careers for the sake of women.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What women!\" said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress\n",
      "with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The firmer the woman's footing in society, the worse it is. That's much\n",
      "the same as--not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms--but tearing\n",
      "it away from someone else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have never loved,\" Vronsky said softly, looking straight before him\n",
      "and thinking of Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps. But you remember what I've said to you. And another thing,\n",
      "women are all more materialistic than men. We make something immense out\n",
      "of love, but they are always _terre-a-terre_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Directly, directly!\" he cried to a footman who came in. But the footman\n",
      "had not come to call them again, as he supposed. The footman brought\n",
      "Vronsky a note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.\"\n",

      "Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.\n",

      "It was six o'clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and at\n",
      "the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to everyone,\n",
      "Vronsky got into Yashvin's hired fly, and told the driver to drive as\n",
      "quickly as possible. It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for\n",
      "four. He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out on the front seat,\n",
      "and sank into meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a\n",
      "vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy, who\n",
      "had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the\n",
      "anticipation of the interview before him--all blended into a general,\n",
      "joyous sense of life. This feeling was so strong that he could not help\n",
      "smiling. He dropped his legs, crossed one leg over the other knee, and\n",
      "taking it in his hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it had\n",
      "been grazed the day before by his fall, and leaning back he drew several\n",
      "deep breaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm happy, very happy!\" he said to himself. He had often before had\n",
      "this sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never felt so\n",
      "fond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment. He enjoyed the\n",
      "slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular sensation of\n",
      "movement in his chest as he breathed. The bright, cold August day, which\n",
      "had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating, and\n",
      "refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water. The\n",
      "scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly\n",
      "pleasant in the fresh air. Everything he saw from the carriage window,\n",
      "everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was\n",
      "as fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the houses\n",
      "shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of fences and\n",
      "angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the carriages that met\n",
      "him now and then, the motionless green of the trees and grass, the\n",
      "fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows\n",
      "that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows\n",
      "of potatoes--everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished\n",
      "and freshly varnished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get on, get on!\" he said to the driver, putting his head out of the\n",

      "meet me, and why does she write in Betsy's letter?\" he thought,\n",
      "wondering now for the first time at it. But there was now no time for\n",
      "wonder. He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and\n",
      "opening the door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went\n",
      "into the avenue that led up to the house. There was no one in the\n",
      "avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her. Her face\n",
      "was hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the special\n",
      "movement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of the shoulders,\n",
      "and the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric shock ran\n",
      "all over him. With fresh force, he felt conscious of himself from the\n",
      "springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he\n",
      "breathed, and something set his lips twitching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to see you,\" she\n",
      "said; and the serious and set line of her lips, which he saw under the\n",
      "veil, transformed his mood at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I angry! But how have you come, where from?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" she said, laying her hand on his, \"come along, I must talk\n",
      "to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be\n",
      "a joyous one. In her presence he had no will of his own: without knowing\n",
      "the grounds of her distress, he already felt the same distress\n",
      "unconsciously passing over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it? what?\" he asked her, squeezing her hand with his elbow, and\n",

      "suddenly she stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did not tell you yesterday,\" she began, breathing quickly and\n",
      "painfully, \"that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him\n",
      "everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him\n",
      "everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as\n",
      "though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for\n",
      "her. But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a\n",
      "proud and hard expression came over his face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's better, a thousand times better! I know how painful it\n",
      "was,\" he said. But she was not listening to his words, she was reading\n",
      "his thoughts from the expression of his face. She could not guess that\n",
      "that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to\n",
      "Vronsky--that a duel was now inevitable. The idea of a duel had never\n",
      "crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation on this\n",
      "passing expression of hardness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got her husband's letter, she knew then at the bottom of her\n",
      "heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not\n",
      "have the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son,\n",
      "and to join her lover. The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya's had\n",
      "confirmed her still more in this. But this interview was still of the\n",
      "utmost gravity for her. She hoped that this interview would transform\n",
      "her position, and save her. If on hearing this news he were to say to\n",
      "her resolutely, passionately, without an instant's wavering: \"Throw up\n",
      "everything and come with me!\" she would give up her son and go away with\n",
      "him. But this news had not produced what she had expected in him; he\n",
      "simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of itself,\" she said\n",
      "irritably; \"and see...\" she pulled her husband's letter out of her\n",
      "glove.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I understand, I understand,\" he interrupted her, taking the letter, but\n",
      "not reading it, and trying to soothe her. \"The one thing I longed for,\n",
      "the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as to\n",
      "devote my life to your happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you tell me that?\" she said. \"Do you suppose I can doubt it? If\n",
      "I doubted...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that coming?\" said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies\n",
      "walking towards them. \"Perhaps they know us!\" and he hurriedly turned\n",
      "off, drawing her after him into a side path.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't care!\" she said. Her lips were quivering. And he fancied\n",
      "that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil. \"I\n",
      "tell you that's not the point--I can't doubt that; but see what he\n",
      "writes to me. Read it.\" She stood still again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her\n",
      "husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away\n",
      "by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the\n",
      "betrayed husband. Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could\n",
      "not help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at\n",
      "home today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same\n",
      "cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he\n",
      "would await the injured husband's shot, after having himself fired into\n",
      "the air. And at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought\n",
      "of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himself been\n",
      "thinking in the morning--that it was better not to bind himself--and he\n",
      "knew that this thought he could not tell her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no\n",
      "determination in them. She saw at once that he had been thinking about\n",
      "it before by himself. She knew that whatever he might say to her, he\n",
      "would not say all he thought. And she knew that her last hope had failed\n",
      "her. This was not what she had been reckoning on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see the sort of man he is,\" she said, with a shaking voice; \"he...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,\" Vronsky interrupted. \"For God's sake,\n",
      "let me finish!\" he added, his eyes imploring her to give him time to\n",
      "explain his words. \"I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot possibly\n",
      "remain as he supposes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why can't they?\" Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously\n",
      "attaching no sort of consequence to what he said. She felt that her fate\n",
      "was sealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky meant that after the duel--inevitable, he thought--things could\n",
      "not go on as before, but he said something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It can't go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope\"--he was\n",
      "confused, and reddened--\"that you will let me arrange and plan our life.\n",
      "Tomorrow...\" he was beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not let him go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But my child!\" she shrieked. \"You see what he writes! I should have to\n",
      "leave him, and I can't and won't do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But, for God's sake, which is better?--leave your child, or keep up\n",
      "this degrading position?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To whom is it degrading?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You say degrading ... don't say that. Those words have no meaning for\n",
      "me,\" she said in a shaking voice. She did not want him now to say what\n",
      "was untrue. She had nothing left her but his love, and she wanted to\n",
      "love him. \"Don't you understand that from the day I loved you everything\n",
      "has changed for me? For me there is one thing, and one thing only--your\n",
      "love. If that's mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be\n",
      "humiliating to me. I am proud of my position, because ... proud of being\n",
      "... proud....\" She could not say what she was proud of. Tears of shame\n",
      "and despair choked her utterance. She stood still and sobbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his\n",
      "nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of\n",
      "weeping. He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so. He\n",
      "felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he\n",
      "knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done\n",
      "something wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is not a divorce possible?\" he said feebly. She shook her head, not\n",
      "answering. \"Couldn't you take your son, and still leave him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him,\" she said\n",
      "shortly. Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.\"\n",

      "grass and weeds and of no use for seed; again and again they mowed the\n",
      "best acres of clover, justifying themselves by the pretense that the\n",
      "bailiff had told them to, and trying to pacify him with the assurance\n",
      "that it would be splendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those\n",

      "waving above him. And he was told, \"Don't trouble, your honor, sure, the\n",
      "womenfolks will pitch it quick enough.\" The ploughs were practically\n",
      "useless, because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share\n",
      "when he turned the plough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses\n",
      "and tore up the ground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it. The\n",

      "would consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the\n",
      "contrary, the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and\n",

      "anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he knew that\n",

      "complained that things were doing badly. But Levin saw that he simply\n",
      "did so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a\n",
      "flourishing condition. If it had been unsuccessful he would not have\n",
      "bought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he would not have married\n",
      "his three sons and a nephew, he would not have rebuilt twice after\n",
      "fires, and each time on a larger scale. In spite of the old man's\n",

      "prosperity, proud of his sons, his nephew, his sons' wives, his horses\n",
      "and his cows, and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this\n",
      "farming going. From his conversation with the old man, Levin thought he\n",
      "was not averse to new methods either. He had planted a great many\n",
      "potatoes, and his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were already\n",
      "past flowering and beginning to die down, while Levin's were only just\n",
      "coming into flower. He earthed up his potatoes with a modern plough\n",
      "borrowed from a neighboring landowner. He sowed wheat. The trifling fact\n",
      "that, thinning out his rye, the old man used the rye he thinned out for\n",
      "his horses, specially struck Levin. How many times had Levin seen this\n",
      "splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get it saved; but always it had\n",

      "that we don't know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of\n",
      "agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low. We\n",
      "have no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don't even\n",
      "know how to keep accounts. Ask any landowner; he won't be able to tell\n",
      "you what crop's profitable, and what's not.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why do they spoil things? A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian\n",

      "they're any good. For my part, anyway, whatever I've spent money on in\n",

      "system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss. Come,\n",
      "tell us how does your land do--does it pay?\" said Levin, and at once in\n",

      "Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer\n",
      "invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a\n",
      "consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of\n",
      "their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three\n",
      "thousand odd roubles. She did not remember the precise sum, but it\n",
      "appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a\n",
      "farthing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of\n",
      "Sviazhsky's famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and\n",
      "marshal was likely to be making.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possibly it does not pay,\" answered Sviazhsky. \"That merely proves\n",
      "either that I'm a bad manager, or that I've sunk my capital for the\n",
      "increase of my rents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, rent!\" Levin cried with horror. \"Rent there may be in Europe, where\n",
      "land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all the\n",
      "land is deteriorating from the labor put into it--in other words they're\n",
      "working it out; so there's no question of rent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How no rent? It's a law.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point\n",
      "when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the\n",
      "gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the difficulty\n",
      "arises from the fact that we don't find out the peculiarities and habits\n",
      "of our laborer; but the landowner, like all men who think independently\n",
      "and in isolation, was slow in taking in any other person's idea, and\n",
      "particularly partial to his own. He stuck to it that the Russian peasant\n",
      "is a swine and likes swinishness, and that to get him out of his\n",
      "swinishness one must have authority, and there is none; one must have\n",
      "the stick, and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden\n",
      "replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and\n",
      "model prisons, where the worthless, stinking peasant is fed on good soup\n",
      "and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think,\" said Levin, trying to get back to the question,\n",
      "\"that it's impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the\n",
      "labor would become productive?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we've no power over\n",
      "them,\" answered the landowner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can new conditions be found?\" said Sviazhsky. Having eaten some\n",
      "junket and lighted a cigarette, he came back to the discussion. \"All\n",
      "possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied,\" he\n",
      "said. \"The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each guarantee\n",
      "for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been abolished--there\n",
      "remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed and ready made,\n",
      "and must be adopted. Permanent hands, day-laborers, rammers--you can't\n",
      "get out of those forms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones. And will find them, in all\n",
      "probability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just what I was meaning,\" answered Levin. \"Why shouldn't we seek\n",
      "them for ourselves?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for\n",
      "constructing railways. They are ready, invented.\"\n",

      "And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; we'll bury the world under our caps! We've found the secret\n",
      "Europe was seeking for! I've heard all that; but, excuse me, do you know\n",
      "all that's been done in Europe on the question of the organization of\n",
      "labor?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, very little.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe. The\n",
      "Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of\n",

      "\n",

      "Sviazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" said Levin with annoyance; \"that method of doctoring I merely\n",
      "meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools. The people are\n",
      "poor and ignorant--that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the\n",
      "baby is ill because it screams. But in what way this trouble of poverty\n",
      "and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how\n",
      "the hen-roost affects the screaming. What has to be cured is what makes\n",

      "Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that\n",

      "Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but as\n",
      "the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our\n",
      "system of culture in accordance with that. Imagine, I ought to have said\n",
      "to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that you\n",
      "have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success\n",

      "to do this?--that's a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be done.\"\n",

      "early in the morning. Besides, the sister-in-law with her low-necked\n",
      "bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some\n",

      "conditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was\n",
      "impossible, and determined to divide it up. The cattle-yard, the garden,\n",
      "hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to be made\n",
      "into separate lots. The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin\n",

      "that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for\n",

      "same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions,\n",
      "always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but as rented for\n",
      "half the crop, and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov himself said\n",
      "to Levin, \"If you would take a rent for the land, it would save you\n",
      "trouble, and we should be more free.\" Moreover the same peasants kept\n",
      "putting off, on various excuses, the building of a cattleyard and barn\n",
      "on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it till the winter.\n",

      "Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the\n",

      "not to let themselves be taken in. He felt this especially when he\n",
      "talked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the\n",

      "Sviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye. But he would never go\n",
      "to see them again either. He did not care about that now. The business\n",
      "of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as\n",
      "though there would never be anything else in his life. He read the books\n",
      "lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he read both\n",
      "the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he had\n",
      "anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken. In\n",
      "the books on political economy--in Mill, for instance, whom he studied\n",
      "first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer to the\n",
      "questions that were engrossing him--he found laws deduced from the\n",
      "condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these laws,\n",
      "which did not apply in Russia, must be general. He saw just the same\n",
      "thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but\n",
      "impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student,\n",
      "or they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in\n",
      "which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia\n",
      "had nothing in common. Political economy told him that the laws by which\n",
      "the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were\n",
      "universal and unvarying. Socialism told him that development along these\n",
      "lines leads to ruin. And neither of them gave an answer, or even a hint,\n",

      "done there was not what was wanted. Levin was only waiting for the\n",
      "delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad. But the\n",

      "Having finished all his business, soaked through with the streams of\n",
      "water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his\n",
      "gaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned\n",
      "homewards in the evening. The weather had become worse than ever towards\n",
      "evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went\n",
      "along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right under\n",
      "his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams\n",
      "running under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at\n",
      "the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the\n",
      "bridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay heaped\n",
      "up about the stripped elm-tree. In spite of the gloominess of nature\n",
      "around him, he felt peculiarly eager. The talks he had been having with\n",
      "the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning\n",
      "to get used to their new position. The old servant to whose hut he had\n",
      "gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin's plan, and of his own\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my\n",

      "This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public\n",
      "welfare comes into it. The whole system of culture, the chief element in\n",
      "the condition of the people, must be completely transformed. Instead of\n",
      "poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility, harmony\n",
      "and unity of interests. In short, a bloodless revolution, but a\n",
      "revolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of\n",
      "our district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world. Because a\n",
      "just idea cannot but be fruitful. Yes, it's an aim worth working for.\n",

      "was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such\n",
      "a pitiful, worthless creature--that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin\n",
      "felt just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of\n",
      "himself as a whole. That means nothing. And he too, most likely, had an\n",

      "part of the money for the wheat. An agreement had been made with the old\n",
      "servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the\n",
      "corn was still standing in the fields, so that his one hundred and sixty\n",

      "before him with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged\n",
      "themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories. \"I must write\n",

      "him, and Agafea Mihalovna's hint, was in a troubled and uncertain humor,\n",

      "that lay before him. In spite of his exaggerated stoop, and the\n",
      "emaciation that was so striking from his height, his movements were as\n",

      "He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin\n",
      "often remembered him in childhood. He even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch\n",

      "asked after the old servants. The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Levin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing to say.\n",
      "Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother about\n",

      "\n",

      "to speak of it, and so whatever they said--not uttering the one thought\n",
      "that filled their minds--was all falsehood. Never had Levin been so glad\n",
      "when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed. Never with any\n",
      "outside person, never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and\n",
      "false as he was that evening. And the consciousness of this\n",
      "unnaturalness, and the remorse he felt at it, made him even more\n",
      "unnatural. He wanted to weep over his dying, dearly loved brother, and\n",
      "he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin\n",
      "put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.\n",

      "clear, mumbled something. Sometimes when his breathing was painful, he\n",
      "said, \"Oh, my God!\" Sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily,\n",
      "\"Ah, the devil!\" Levin could not sleep for a long while, hearing him.\n",
      "His thoughts were of the most various, but the end of all his thoughts\n",
      "was the same--death. Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first\n",
      "time presented itself to him with irresistible force. And death, which\n",
      "was here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit\n",
      "calling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as\n",
      "it had hitherto seemed to him. It was in himself too, he felt that. If\n",
      "not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn't it all the\n",
      "same! And what was this inevitable death--he did not know, had never\n",
      "thought about it, and what was more, had not the power, had not the\n",
      "courage to think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I\n",

      "He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and\n",
      "holding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered. But the more\n",
      "intensely he thought, the clearer it became to him that it was\n",
      "indubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he had forgotten one\n",
      "little fact--that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was even\n",
      "worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway. Yes, it was\n",
      "awful, but it was so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I am alive still. Now what's to be done? what's to be done?\" he\n",

      "looking-glass, and began looking at his face and hair. Yes, there were\n",
      "gray hairs about his temples. He opened his mouth. His back teeth were\n",
      "beginning to decay. He bared his muscular arms. Yes, there was strength\n",
      "in them. But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of\n",
      "lungs, had had a strong, healthy body too. And suddenly he recalled how\n",
      "they used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited\n",
      "till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each\n",
      "other and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor\n",
      "Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, he's dying--yes, he'll die in the spring, and how help him? What\n",

      "Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the\n",
      "servants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at\n",

      "Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable\n",

      "not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly\n",

      "apart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week. A\n",
      "foreign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under his\n",
      "charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing. Vronsky was of\n",
      "distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of behaving\n",
      "with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand\n",
      "personages--that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince. But\n",
      "he felt his duties very irksome. The prince was anxious to miss nothing\n",
      "of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in Russia? And on\n",
      "his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms\n",
      "of amusement. Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both\n",
      "these inclinations. The mornings they spent driving to look at places of\n",
      "interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments.\n",
      "The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes. By\n",
      "gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to\n",
      "such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh\n",
      "as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber. The prince had traveled a great\n",
      "deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of\n",
      "communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made\n",
      "friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin. In Switzerland he\n",
      "had killed chamois. In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges\n",
      "and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet. In Turkey he had got into a\n",
      "harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia he\n",
      "wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him, was\n",
      "at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by\n",
      "various persons to the prince. They had race horses, and Russian\n",
      "pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and\n",
      "drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery. And\n",
      "the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed\n",
      "trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and seemed to\n",
      "be asking--what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just\n",
      "this?\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best\n",

      "or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed\n",
      "fearfully wearisome to him. The whole of that week he experienced a\n",
      "sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman,\n",
      "afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him, fearing\n",
      "for his own reason. Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity\n",
      "of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official\n",
      "respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted. The prince's\n",
      "manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky's surprise, were\n",
      "ready to descend to any depths to provide him with Russian amusements,\n",
      "was contemptuous. His criticisms of Russian women, whom he wished to\n",
      "study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with indignation. The chief\n",
      "reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to Vronsky was\n",
      "that he could not help seeing himself in him. And what he saw in this\n",
      "mirror did not gratify his self-esteem. He was a very stupid and very\n",
      "self-satisfied and very healthy and very well-washed man, and nothing\n",
      "else. He was a gentleman--that was true, and Vronsky could not deny it.\n",
      "He was equable and not cringing with his superiors, was free and\n",
      "ingratiating in his behavior with his equals, and was contemptuously\n",
      "indulgent with his inferiors. Vronsky was himself the same, and regarded\n",

      "\n",
      "Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left\n",

      "he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the\n",

      "together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who\n",
      "had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.\n",
      "He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light\n",

      "Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was\n",
      "stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began saying some\n",
      "strange words in French. Yes, there was nothing else in the dream,\" he\n",

      "It was half-past eight already. He rang up his servant, dressed in\n",
      "haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and\n",
      "only worried at being late. As he drove up to the Karenins' entrance he\n",
      "looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine. A high, narrow\n",
      "carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance. He\n",
      "recognized Anna's carriage. \"She is coming to me,\" thought Vronsky, \"and\n",
      "better she should. I don't like going into that house. But no matter; I\n",
      "can't hide myself,\" he thought, and with that manner peculiar to him\n",
      "from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky\n",
      "got out of his sledge and went to the door. The door opened, and the\n",
      "hall porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage. Vronsky, though\n",
      "he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the amazed\n",
      "expression with which the porter glanced at him. In the very doorway\n",
      "Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch. The gas jet threw\n",
      "its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on\n",
      "the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat. Karenin's\n",
      "fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky's face. Vronsky bowed, and\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to his hat and\n",
      "went on. Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage,\n",
      "pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and disappear. Vronsky\n",
      "went into the hall. His brows were scowling, and his eyes gleamed with a\n",
      "proud and angry light in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a position!\" he thought. \"If he would fight, would stand up for\n",
      "his honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or\n",

      "decide her fate, ready to submit to anything--he had long ceased to\n",
      "think that their tie might end as he had thought then. His ambitious\n",
      "plans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he had\n",
      "got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he\n",
      "had given himself entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding\n",
      "him more and more closely to her.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her voice the\n",

      "and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for\n",
      "her all the good things of life--and he was much further from happiness\n",
      "than when he had followed her from Moscow. Then he had thought himself\n",
      "unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that the best\n",
      "happiness was already left behind. She was utterly unlike what she had\n",

      "He understands nothing, and feels nothing. Could a man of any feeling\n",
      "live in the same house with his unfaithful wife? Could he talk to her,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know you and the good\"--again he caught a moth--\"work you are doing,\n",
      "like every Russian,\" said the lawyer, bowing.\n",
      "\n",

      "with my wife by legal means--that is, to be divorced, but to do this so\n",
      "that my son may not remain with his mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer's gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with\n",
      "irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply\n",
      "the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there was\n",
      "triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your\n",
      "time and attention. I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary\n",
      "step. I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of great\n",
      "consequence to me. It is very possible that if that form does not\n",
      "correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that's always the case,\" said the lawyer, \"and that's always for\n",

      "\n",
      "He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch's feet, feeling that he\n",
      "might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement. He\n",
      "looked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but did\n",
      "not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch's position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to\n",
      "me,\" pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, \"I should be glad to have an idea of\n",
      "the forms in which such things are done in practice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You would be glad,\" the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded,\n",
      "adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client's remarks,\n",
      "\"for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what\n",
      "you desire?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went on,\n",
      "stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch's face, which\n",
      "was growing red in patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Divorce by our laws,\" he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation of\n",
      "our laws, \"is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....\n",
      "Wait a little!\" he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door,\n",
      "but he got up all the same, said a few words to him, and sat down again.\n",
      "\"... In the following cases: physical defect in the married parties,\n",
      "desertion without communication for five years,\" he said, crooking a\n",
      "short finger covered with hair, \"adultery\" (this word he pronounced with\n",
      "obvious satisfaction), \"subdivided as follows\" (he continued to crook\n",
      "his fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions could\n",
      "obviously not be classified together): \"physical defect of the husband\n",
      "or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the wife.\" As by now all\n",
      "his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his fingers and went on:\n",
      "\"This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you have done me the honor\n",
      "to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice. And\n",
      "therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you that in practice\n",
      "cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following--there's no\n",
      "physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.\n",
      "\n",

      "parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual\n",
      "agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection. It must be\n",
      "admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,\" said the\n",
      "lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused, as a\n",
      "man selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon,\n",
      "might await his customer's choice. But Alexey Alexandrovitch said\n",
      "nothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: \"The most usual and simple,\n",
      "the sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent. I should\n",
      "not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no\n",
      "education,\" he said, \"but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not\n",
      "immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent,\n",

      "his assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People cannot go on living together--here you have a fact. And if both\n",
      "are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no\n",
      "importance. And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain\n",
      "method.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now. But he had religious\n",
      "scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is out of the question in the present case,\" he said. \"Only one\n",
      "alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters\n",
      "which I have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave\n",
      "utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kindly consider,\" he began, \"cases of that kind are, as you are aware,\n",
      "under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of\n",
      "going into the minutest details in cases of that kind,\" he said with a\n",
      "smile, which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers' taste.\n",
      "\"Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in the\n",
      "fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by eyewitnesses. In\n",
      "fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me, you will\n",
      "do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed. If one\n",
      "wants the result, one must admit the means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it is so...\" Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white;\n",
      "but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak\n",
      "to the intruding clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell her we don't haggle over fees!\" he said, and returned to Alexey\n",

      "\n",
      "On his way back he caught unobserved another moth. \"Nice state my rep\n",

      "that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms to the\n",

      "and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy\n",
      "inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch. Within three months a report was\n",

      "political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and\n",
      "religious aspects. To all these questions there were answers admirably\n",
      "stated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a\n",
      "product of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the\n",
      "product of official activity. The answers were all based on official\n",
      "data furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the\n",
      "reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents,\n",
      "founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish\n",

      "back, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded\n",

      "affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance. Consequently Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non-official\n",

      "Stepan Arkadyevitch. He threw open his coat, but afterwards did take it\n",
      "off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and the\n",
      "most intimate subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad? Where have you been?\" said\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England--not in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia the\n",

      "interested. Shtcherbatsky told me another story--he met you--that you\n",

      "nonsense. It's the truth I'm telling you. I do value my idea and my work\n",
      "awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours is\n",
      "nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet. And\n",
      "for us to suppose we can have something great--ideas, work--it's all\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow\n",
      "everything becomes of no consequence. When you understand that you will\n",
      "die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything is\n",
      "so unimportant! And I consider my idea very important, but it turns out\n",
      "really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing\n",
      "for that bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with\n",

      "moralist!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; all the same, what's fine in life is...\" Levin hesitated--\"oh, I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why so soon?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"I'm a nice person! Why, that's just what I came for! You simply must\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You don't mean to say he's here?\" said Levin, and he wanted to inquire\n",

      "tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly,\n",
      "to write the promised letter to the lawyer. The deputation, though it\n",
      "had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch's instigation, was not\n",
      "without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was glad he\n",
      "had found it in Moscow. The members of this deputation had not the\n",
      "slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play. They\n",
      "naively believed that it was their business to lay before the commission\n",
      "their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask assistance of\n",
      "the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of their\n",
      "statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy's side,\n",
      "and so spoiled the whole business. Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily\n",
      "engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them from\n",
      "which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a letter to\n",
      "Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation. He had his chief support\n",
      "in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna. She was a specialist in\n",
      "the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than she how to manage\n",
      "them, and put them in the way they should go. Having completed this\n",
      "task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer. Without the\n",
      "slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge\n",

      "he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of\n",

      "treated his best friends to this honor. But at that instant Konstantin\n",
      "Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making\n",
      "such an acquaintance. He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening\n",
      "when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he had had a\n",
      "glimpse of her on the highroad. He had known at the bottom of his heart\n",
      "that he would see her here today. But to keep his thoughts free, he had\n",
      "tried to persuade himself that he did not know it. Now when he heard\n",
      "that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What is she like, what is she like? Like what she used to be, or like\n",

      "She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in\n",
      "the carriage; she was quite different.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it. She\n",
      "saw him the very instant he walked into the room. She had been expecting\n",
      "him. She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight that there\n",
      "was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again\n",
      "at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she would\n",
      "break down and would begin to cry. She crimsoned, turned white,\n",
      "crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to\n",
      "come to her. He went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without\n",
      "speaking. Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in\n",
      "her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said:\n",
      "\n",

      "\"So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but\n",

      "\n",
      "Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, that's the best method!\" he said, munching cheese and filling\n",
      "the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit. The conversation dropped\n",
      "at the jest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?\" said the master of the\n",

      "\n",
      "Levin smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not at all. Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,\" he said, with\n",

      "There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what\n",
      "unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of\n",
      "her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it! There was entreaty for\n",
      "forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness--soft, timid\n",
      "tenderness--and promise and hope and love for him, which he could not\n",

      "brother-in-law,\" he said with a smile. \"It was an amusing meeting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all\n",
      "night, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on\n",

      "forgetting his name, \"at first would have ejected me on the ground of\n",

      "\"The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I saw you were in uncertainty about me,\" said Levin, smiling\n",
      "good-naturedly, \"but I made haste to plunge into intellectual\n",
      "conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.\" Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one\n",
      "ear for his brother, and he glanced askance at him. \"What is the matter\n",
      "with him today? Why such a conquering hero?\" he thought. He did not know\n",
      "that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings. Levin knew she was\n",
      "listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him. And this\n",
      "was the only thing that interested him. Not in that room only, but in\n",
      "the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with enormously\n",
      "increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she. He felt\n",
      "himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down below were\n",
      "all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though\n",

      "side by side.\n",

      "\n",
      "The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was\n",
      "a connoisseur. The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the tiny\n",

      "footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and\n",
      "wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly. On the material side the\n",
      "dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial. The\n",
      "conversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never\n",
      "paused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose\n",
      "from the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey\n",

      "Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I did not mean,\" he said over the soup, addressing Alexey\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It seems to me,\" Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no\n",

      "\"But that's just the question,\" Pestsov broke in in his bass.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his whole\n",
      "soul into what he was saying. \"In what are we to make higher development\n",
      "consist? The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest\n",
      "stage of development? Which of them will nationalize the other? We see\n",
      "the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at\n",
      "a lower stage!\" he shouted. \"There is another law at work there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true\n",

      "Alexandrovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But are they fully known?\" Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle\n",
      "smile. \"It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely\n",
      "classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the\n",
      "question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong\n",
      "points in its favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch. Will you take red wine?\" said\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,\" Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension, as\n",
      "to a child. \"I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support\n",
      "them,\" he went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch. \"My sympathies are\n",
      "classical from education, but in this discussion I am personally unable\n",
      "to arrive at a conclusion. I see no distinct grounds for classical\n",
      "studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,\" put in\n",
      "Pestsov. \"Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of\n",
      "general principles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I cannot quite agree with that,\" responded Alexey Alexandrovitch \"It\n",
      "seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the\n",
      "forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual\n",
      "development. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the\n",
      "classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately,\n",
      "with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and\n",
      "noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him\n",
      "in his rich bass. He began warmly contesting the justice of this view.\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing\n",
      "reply ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin,\n",
      "\"One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of\n",
      "classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question\n",
      "which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so\n",
      "quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of\n",
      "classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral--disons le\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic\n",

      "the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,\" said Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, \"we should have given elbow-room to both\n",
      "tendencies. But now we know that these little pills of classical\n",
      "learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly\n",
      "prescribe them to our patients.... But what if they had no such\n",
      "medicinal property?\" he wound up humorously.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Sergey Ivanovitch's little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in\n",
      "especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found\n",
      "something to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to\n",
      "conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov. With\n",
      "Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant. Directly\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest, Pestsov\n",
      "promptly started a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't agree even,\" said he, \"that the government had that aim. The\n",
      "government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains\n",
      "indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. The education of\n",
      "women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be\n",
      "harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education\n",
      "of women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is\n",
      "apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only\n",
      "so that it can be considered dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably\n",
      "connected together,\" said Pestsov; \"it is a vicious circle. Woman is\n",
      "deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education\n",
      "results from the absence of rights. We must not forget that the\n",
      "subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that\n",
      "we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from\n",
      "us,\" said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You said rights,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had\n",
      "finished, \"meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of\n",
      "presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service,\n",
      "of sitting in parliament...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Undoubtedly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems\n",
      "to me you are wrong in using the expression 'rights.' It would be more\n",
      "correct to say duties. Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a\n",
      "juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties.\n",
      "And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties,\n",
      "and quite legitimately. And one can but sympathize with this desire to\n",
      "assist in the general labor of man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Quite so,\" Alexey Alexandrovitch assented. \"The question, I imagine, is\n",
      "simply whether they are fitted for such duties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They will most likely be perfectly fitted,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n",
      "\"when education has become general among them. We see this...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How about the proverb?\" said the prince, who had a long while been\n",
      "intent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling. \"I can\n",
      "say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!\" said\n",
      "Pestsov angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,\" said\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, \"while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to\n",
      "avoid them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Duties are bound up with rights--power, money, honor; those are what\n",
      "women are seeking,\" said Pestsov.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel\n",
      "injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take me,\"\n",
      "said the old prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch\n",
      "regretted that he had not made this comparison. Even Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but a man can't nurse a baby,\" said Pestsov, \"while a woman...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship,\"\n",
      "said the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible\n",
      "before his own daughters.\n",

      "\"There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,\"\n",

      "all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she\n",
      "had abandoned a family--her own or a sister's, where she might have\n",

      "\"But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,\" replied Pestsov in\n",

      "never be, did that mean never, or then?\" There seemed no likelihood that\n",
      "she could make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her as\n",
      "though his life depended on her understanding the words. She glanced at\n",
      "him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to\n",
      "read. Once or twice she stole a look at him, as though asking him, \"Is\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I understand,\" she said, flushing a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is this word?\" he said, pointing to the n that stood for _never_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It means _never_,\" she said; \"but that's not true!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood\n",

      "looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table\n",
      "with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.\n",
      "He was suddenly radiant: he had understood. It meant, \"Then I could not\n",
      "answer differently.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Only then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" her smile answered.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, read this. I'll tell you what I should like--should like so\n",
      "much!\" she wrote the initial letters, i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h. This\n",
      "meant, \"If you could forget and forgive what happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it,\n",

      "\n",
      "For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and often\n",
      "looked into her eyes. He was stupefied with happiness. He could not\n",
      "supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with\n",
      "happiness, he saw all he needed to know. And he wrote three letters. But\n",
      "he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and\n",
      "herself finished and wrote the answer, \"Yes.\"\n",

      "without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly\n",
      "as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be\n",
      "plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of\n",
      "those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her. It was\n",
      "essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left\n",
      "alone, to kill time. Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion\n",
      "most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a _soiree_, in\n",
      "reality to the ballet. Levin only had time to tell him he was happy, and\n",
      "that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he had done for\n",
      "him. The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he\n",
      "comprehended that feeling fittingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, so it's not time to die yet?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing\n",

      "congratulation, saying, \"How glad I am you have met Kitty again! One\n",
      "must value old friends.\" Levin did not like these words of Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna's. She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all\n",
      "was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it. Levin said\n",
      "good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"With me? Happiness is the matter with me!\" said Levin, letting down the\n",
      "window of the carriage they were driving in. \"You don't mind?--it's so\n",
      "stifling. It's happiness is the matter with me! Why is it you have never\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't say it! don't say it!\" shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of\n",
      "his fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in it. \"She's a nice\n",

      "feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with\n",
      "him. \"Well, anyway, I may say that I'm very glad of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more! Nothing, nothing,\n",
      "silence,\" said Levin, and muffling him once more in his fur coat, he\n",
      "added: \"I do like you so! Well, is it possible for me to be present at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Of course it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is your discussion about today?\" asked Levin, never ceasing\n",
      "smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived at the meeting. Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read\n",
      "the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw\n",
      "from this secretary's face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person he\n",
      "was. This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading\n",
      "the minutes. Then the discussion began. They were disputing about the\n",
      "misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at\n",
      "great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling\n",
      "something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards\n",
      "answered him very viciously and delightfully. And then Sviazhsky (he was\n",
      "there too) said something too, very handsomely and nobly. Levin listened\n",
      "to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were\n",
      "not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the\n",
      "nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as\n",
      "possible among them. They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying\n",
      "it. What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, and\n",
      "from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw\n",
      "distinctly that they were all good at heart. And Levin himself in\n",
      "particular they were all extremely fond of that day. That was evident\n",
      "from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, affectionate way even\n",
      "those he did not know looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, did you like it?\" Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting! Capital! Splendid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with\n",
      "him. Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he\n",
      "had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him. He was a\n",
      "clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Most delighted,\" he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.\n",
      "And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the\n",
      "idea of Sviazhsky's sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it\n",
      "occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably\n",
      "speak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate,\n",
      "presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing\n",
      "anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least\n",
      "annoy Levin. On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the\n",
      "whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful softness\n",
      "and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his\n",
      "correct view. The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly\n",
      "delightful. It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and\n",
      "sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy. He stayed\n",
      "with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the\n",
      "one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that he was boring\n",
      "them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the\n",
      "strange humor his friend was in. It was past one o'clock. Levin went\n",
      "back to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now\n",
      "with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through. The\n",
      "servant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and\n",
      "would have gone away, but Levin stopped him. This servant, Yegor, whom\n",
      "Levin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent,\n",
      "and, above all, good-hearted man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Yegor, it's hard work not sleeping, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One's got to put up with it! It's part of our work, you see. In a\n",
      "gentleman's house it's easier; but then here one makes more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a\n",
      "sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler's shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in marriage\n",
      "the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy,\n",
      "for happiness rests only on oneself. Yegor listened attentively, and\n",
      "obviously quite took in Levin's idea, but by way of assent to it he\n",
      "enunciated, greatly to Levin's surprise, the observation that when he\n",
      "had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his\n",
      "masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer, though he\n",
      "was a Frenchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!\" thought Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your\n",
      "wife?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ay! and why not?\" responded Yegor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to\n",
      "express all his most heartfelt emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My life, too, has been a wonderful one. From a child up...\" he was\n",
      "beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin's enthusiasm,\n",
      "just as people catch yawning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at that moment a ring was heard. Yegor departed, and Levin was left\n",
      "alone. He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and\n",
      "supper at Sviazhsky's, but he was incapable of thinking of supper. He\n",
      "had not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of sleep\n",
      "either. His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat. He opened both\n",
      "the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the\n",
      "open panes. Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross\n",
      "with chains, and above it the rising triangle of Charles's Wain with the\n",
      "yellowish light of Capella. He gazed at the cross, then at the stars,\n",
      "drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room, and\n",
      "followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his\n",
      "imagination. At four o'clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped\n",
      "out at the door. It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from\n",
      "the club. He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing. \"Poor, unlucky\n",
      "fellow!\" thought Levin, and tears came into his eyes from love and pity\n",
      "for this man. He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him,\n",
      "but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his\n",
      "mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and\n",
      "gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning\n",
      "for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star. At seven o'clock there was\n",
      "a noise of people polishing the floors, and bells ringing in some\n",
      "servants' department, and Levin felt that he was beginning to get\n",
      "frozen. He closed the pane, washed, dressed, and went out into the\n",
      "street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 15\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets were still empty. Levin went to the house of the\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys. The visitors' doors were closed and everything was\n",
      "asleep. He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.\n",
      "The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him. Levin would\n",
      "have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the\n",
      "servant, and he went out. Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll\n",
      "in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the\n",
      "roll. Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for\n",
      "a walk. It was nine o'clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys' steps\n",
      "the second time. In the house they were only just up, and the cook came\n",
      "out to go marketing. He had to get through at least two hours more.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt\n",
      "perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life. He had eaten\n",
      "nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had spent\n",
      "several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher\n",
      "and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his body; he\n",
      "moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do anything. He\n",
      "was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if\n",
      "need be. He spent the remainder of the time in the street, incessantly\n",
      "looking at his watch and gazing about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what he saw then, he never saw again after. The children especially\n",
      "going to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the\n",
      "pavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an\n",
      "unseen hand, touched him. Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys\n",
      "were not earthly creatures. It all happened at the same time: a boy ran\n",
      "towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of\n",
      "her wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that\n",
      "quivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of\n",
      "fresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out. All of this together was\n",
      "so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight. Going\n",
      "a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back again to\n",
      "the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to wait for\n",
      "twelve o'clock. In the next room they were talking about some sort of\n",
      "machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs. They did not\n",
      "realize that the hand was near twelve. The hand reached it. Levin went\n",
      "out onto the steps. The sledge-drivers clearly knew all about it. They\n",
      "crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and\n",
      "offering their services. Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers,\n",
      "and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him to\n",
      "drive to the Shtcherbatskys'. The sledge-driver was splendid in a white\n",
      "shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong,\n",
      "full-blooded red neck. The sledge was high and comfortable, and\n",
      "altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse was a\n",
      "good one, and tried to gallop but didn't seem to move. The driver knew\n",
      "the Shtcherbatskys' house, and drew up at the entrance with a curve of\n",
      "his arm and a \"Wo!\" especially indicative of respect for his fare. The\n",
      "Shtcherbatskys' hall-porter certainly knew all about it. This was\n",
      "evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's a long while since you've been to see us, Konstantin\n",
      "Demitrievitch!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and\n",
      "making efforts to conceal his joy. Looking into his kindly old eyes,\n",
      "Levin realized even something new in his happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are they up?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray walk in! Leave it here,\" said he, smiling, as Levin would have\n",
      "come back to take his hat. That meant something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To whom shall I announce your honor?\" asked the footman.\n",
      "\n",
      "The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen, a\n",
      "dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all about\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The princess ... the prince ... the young princess...\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon. She walked across the\n",
      "room, and her ringlets and her face were beaming. He had only just\n",
      "spoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door,\n",
      "and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin's eyes, and a joyful terror\n",
      "came over him at the nearness of his happiness. Mademoiselle Linon was\n",
      "in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door. Directly\n",
      "she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the parquet, and\n",
      "his bliss, his life, himself--what was best in himself, what he had so\n",
      "long sought and longed for--was quickly, so quickly approaching him. She\n",
      "did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to float to him. He saw\n",
      "nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened by the same bliss of\n",
      "love that flooded his heart. Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer,\n",
      "blinding him with their light of love. She stopped still close to him,\n",
      "touching him. Her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had done all she could--she had run up to him and given herself up\n",
      "entirely, shy and happy. He put his arms round her and pressed his lips\n",
      "to her mouth that sought his kiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the\n",
      "morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in her\n",
      "happiness. She had been waiting for him. She wanted to be the first to\n",
      "tell him her happiness and his. She had got ready to see him alone, and\n",
      "had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did\n",
      "not know herself what she was doing. She had heard his steps and voice,\n",
      "and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go. Mademoiselle\n",
      "Linon had gone away. Without thinking, without asking herself how and\n",
      "what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us go to mamma!\" she said, taking him by the hand. For a long while\n",
      "he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of desecrating\n",
      "the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time he tried to\n",
      "say something, instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were\n",
      "welling up. He took her hand and kissed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Can it be true?\" he said at last in a choked voice. \"I can't believe\n",

      "started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on\n",
      "his arms got in a panic onto his knees. His eyes were wide open as\n",
      "though he had never been asleep. The heaviness in his head and the\n",

      "touched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when\n",
      "he had seen her last. But to think of anything extraneous was an\n",
      "agonizing effort. \"No, I must sleep!\" He moved the cushion up, and\n",

      "reality in it. He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his\n",
      "belt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up\n",
      "and down the room. \"This is how people go mad,\" he repeated, \"and how\n",

      "In reality this \"of course,\" that seemed convincing to him, was simply\n",
      "the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through\n",
      "which he had passed ten times already during the last hour--memories of\n",
      "happiness lost forever. There was the same conception of the\n",
      "senselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of\n",

      "inquired after his wife's health. The presence of Princess Tverskaya was\n",
      "unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with\n",
      "her, and also because he disliked her, and he went straight to the\n",
      "nursery. In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the table with his legs\n",
      "on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily. The English\n",
      "governess, who had during Anna's illness replaced the French one, was\n",

      "and pulled Seryozha.\n",

      "\"The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "baby's screaming in the next room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's the wet-nurse, sir,\" the Englishwoman said firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think so?\" he asked, stopping short.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just as it was at Countess Paul's, sir. They gave the baby\n",
      "medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds\n",
      "he went in at the other door. The baby was lying with its head thrown\n",

      "plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the\n",
      "double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending\n",
      "over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Still no better?\" said Alexey Alexandrovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's very restless,\" answered the nurse in a whisper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why didn't you say so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna still ill...\" said the nurse\n",
      "discontentedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nurse was an old servant of the family. And in her simple words\n",
      "there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing. The nurse,\n",
      "with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse's\n",
      "arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,\" said Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch. The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse,\n",

      "herself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of\n",
      "doubts being cast on her abundance of milk. In that smile, too, Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Luckless child!\" said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking up\n",
      "and down with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering face\n",
      "watched the nurse walking to and fro.\n",

      "the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the\n",
      "baby. For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face gazed\n",
      "at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the skin\n",
      "of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out of the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dining room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in to\n",
      "send again for the doctor. He felt vexed with his wife for not being\n",
      "anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no\n",
      "wish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy. But\n",
      "his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so,\n",
      "overcoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom. As he walked\n",
      "over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help overhearing a\n",
      "conversation he did not want to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he hadn't been going away, I could have understood your answer and\n",

      "answered Anna's excited voice.\n",

      "\"Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself on\n",
      "your account....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's just why I don't want to.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and\n",
      "would have gone back unobserved. But reflecting that this would be\n",
      "undignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up\n",
      "to the bedroom. The voices were silent, and he went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black\n",
      "curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee. The eagerness died out\n",
      "of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she dropped\n",
      "her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy. Betsy, dressed in the\n",
      "height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her\n",
      "head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway\n",
      "stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt,\n",
      "was sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect. Bowing her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" she said, as though surprised. \"I'm very glad you're at home. You\n",
      "never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven't seen you ever since\n",
      "Anna has been ill. I have heard all about it--your anxiety. Yes, you're\n",
      "a wonderful husband!\" she said, with a meaning and affable air, as\n",

      "to his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife's hand, asked\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but...\" he said, feeling\n",
      "with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and\n",
      "clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya, who\n",
      "to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would\n",
      "inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world, and\n",
      "hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness. He\n",
      "stopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, good-bye, my darling,\" said Betsy, getting up. She kissed Anna,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Alexey Alexandrovitch! I know you are a truly magnanimous man,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice. But the question of\n",
      "whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected\n",
      "immediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity\n",
      "in his position. And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am very grateful for your confidence in me.\" He repeated gently in\n",

      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing. She played nervously with\n",
      "the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that torturing\n",

      "his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all\n",

      "be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they all\n",
      "thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these\n",
      "relations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced, and\n",
      "he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position. Bad as\n",
      "this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put her\n",
      "in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him of everything he\n",

      "against him, and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him\n",

      "\"Oh, I'm so glad!\" answered Betsy, at once understanding that he was\n",
      "speaking of Anna. And going back into the drawing room, they stood in a\n",

      "smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so much of\n",
      "sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound,\n",
      "but softened and soothed. His gentle, soothing words and smiles were as\n",
      "soothing and softening as almond oil. And Anna soon felt this.\n",

      "I can. Let me tell you candidly my opinion.\" Again he smiled discreetly\n",
      "his almond-oil smile. \"I'll begin from the beginning. You married a man\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to\n",
      "himself, and made no answer. All that seemed so simple to Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times.\n",
      "And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly impossible.\n",
      "Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed to him now\n",
      "out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity and respect\n",
      "for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of\n",
      "adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and beloved by\n",
      "him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame. Divorce appeared\n",
      "to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would become of his son in case of a divorce? To leave him with his\n",
      "mother was out of the question. The divorced mother would have her own\n",
      "illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his\n",
      "education would not be good. Keep him with him? He knew that would be an\n",
      "act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want. But apart from\n",
      "this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey\n",
      "Alexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be\n",
      "completely ruining Anna. The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow,\n",
      "that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not\n",
      "considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk\n",
      "into his heart. And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her,\n",
      "with his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.\n",
      "To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts\n",
      "to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life--the children\n",
      "whom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the\n",
      "path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin. If she were divorced, he\n",
      "knew she would join her life to Vronsky's, and their tie would be an\n",
      "illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of\n",
      "the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her husband was living.\n",
      "\"She will join him, and in a year or two he will throw her over, or she\n",
      "will form a new tie,\" thought Alexey Alexandrovitch. \"And I, by agreeing\n",
      "to an unlawful divorce, shall be to blame for her ruin.\" He had thought\n",
      "it all over hundreds of times, and was convinced that a divorce was not\n",
      "at all simple, as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said, but was utterly\n",
      "impossible. He did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to\n",
      "him; to every word he had a thousand objections to make, but he listened\n",
      "to him, feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal\n",
      "force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce. She\n",
      "does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she leaves\n",
      "it all to your generosity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My God, my God! what for?\" thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering\n",
      "the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame\n",
      "on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done\n",
      "the same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.\n",

      "\"You are distressed, I understand that. But if you think it over...\"\n",

      "let it alone? Still you may do as you like...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat\n",
      "down on a chair at the window. There was bitterness, there was shame in\n",
      "his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the\n",
      "height of his own meekness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched. He was silent for a space.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity,\" he\n",
      "said. \"But it seems it was the will of God,\" he added, and as he said it\n",
      "felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed a smile\n",
      "at his own foolishness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. I accept\n",
      "the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both\n",

      "\n",
      "When he went out of his brother-in-law's room he was touched, but that\n",
      "did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the\n",
      "matter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would\n",
      "not go back on his words. To this satisfaction was added the fact that\n",
      "an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful\n",
      "achievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and\n",
      "most intimate friends. He put this riddle into two or three different\n",
      "ways. \"But I'll work it out better than that,\" he said to himself with a\n",

      "Vronsky's wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the\n",

      "\n",
      "Without answering his words, Varya bent over him, and with a delighted\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Thank God!\" she said. \"You're not in pain?\"\n",

      "were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before. He could\n",
      "now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch. He recognized all his\n",
      "magnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it. Besides,\n",
      "he got back again into the beaten track of his life. He saw the\n",
      "possibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he could\n",
      "live in accordance with his own habits. One thing he could not pluck out\n",
      "of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was the regret,\n",
      "amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever. That now, having\n",

      "Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting\n",
      "all his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her\n",

      "stairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost breaking\n",
      "into a run, he went into her room. And without considering, without\n",
      "noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung his arms\n",
      "round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck with kisses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she\n",

      "too late. His feeling infected her. Her lips trembled so that for a long\n",
      "while she could say nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,\" she said at last, pressing\n",

      "And she could not but respond with a smile--not to his words, but to the\n",

      "ill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still\n",
      "longer. And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two\n",
      "parts--a larger and smaller trousseau--the princess consented to have\n",
      "the wedding before Lent. She determined that she would get the smaller\n",
      "part of the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made\n",
      "later, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of\n",
      "giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this\n",

      "that everything was being done and would be done for him by others. He\n",

      "an empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the\n",
      "sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing\n",

      "to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and\n",

      "this idle time of standing in church.\n",

      "going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation. During the\n",
      "reading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same\n",
      "words, \"Lord, have mercy on us!\" which resounded with an echo, Levin\n",
      "felt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be\n",
      "touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so standing\n",
      "behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs, neither\n",
      "listening nor examining what was said. \"It's wonderful what expression\n",
      "there is in her hand,\" he thought, remembering how they had been sitting\n",
      "the day before at a corner table. They had nothing to talk about, as was\n",
      "almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand on the table\n",
      "she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as she watched her\n",
      "action. He remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the\n",
      "lines on the pink palm. \"Have mercy on us again!\" thought Levin,\n",
      "crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple spring of the\n",
      "deacon's back bowing before him. \"She took my hand then and examined the\n",
      "lines 'You've got a splendid hand,' she said.\" And he looked at his own\n",
      "hand and the short hand of the deacon. \"Yes, now it will soon be over,\"\n",

      "Levin's head, but he made haste to drive it away. \"It will come right\n",
      "somehow,\" he thought, and went towards the altar-rails. He went up the\n",
      "steps, and turning to the right saw the priest. The priest, a little old\n",
      "man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary, good-natured eyes, was\n",
      "standing at the altar-rails, turning over the pages of a missal. With a\n",
      "slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official\n",
      "voice. When he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned,\n",
      "facing Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,\" he said,\n",
      "pointing to the crucifix. \"Do you believe in all the doctrines of the\n",
      "Holy Apostolic Church?\" the priest went on, turning his eyes away from\n",
      "Levin's face and folding his hands under his stole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have doubted, I doubt everything,\" said Levin in a voice that jarred\n",
      "on himself, and he ceased speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, and\n",
      "closing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God\n",
      "in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special sins?\" he added,\n",
      "without the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for the most\n",
      "part I am in doubt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,\" the priest repeated the\n",
      "same words. \"What do you doubt about principally?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doubt of everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of\n",
      "God,\" Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the\n",
      "impropriety of what he was saying. But Levin's words did not, it seemed,\n",
      "make much impression on the priest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?\" he said\n",
      "hurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin did not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?\"\n",

      "heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has clothed the earth in its\n",
      "beauty? How explain it without the Creator?\" he said, looking\n",
      "inquiringly at Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical\n",
      "discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a\n",
      "direct answer to the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?\" the\n",
      "priest said, with good-humored perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand it at all,\" said Levin, blushing, and feeling that\n",
      "his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid in\n",
      "such a position.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts, and\n",
      "prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power, and\n",
      "we must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray to God,\" he repeated\n",
      "hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son\n",
      "in the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?\" he resumed, with a smile. \"An\n",
      "excellent young lady.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" answered Levin, blushing for the priest. \"What does he want to\n",
      "ask me about this at confession for?\" he thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with\n",
      "offspring. Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if you\n",
      "do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to\n",
      "infidelity?\" he said, with gentle reproachfulness. \"If you love your\n",
      "child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor\n",
      "for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual\n",
      "enlightenment with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make him\n",
      "when the innocent babe asks you: 'Papa! who made all that enchants me in\n",
      "this world--the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the grass?' Can\n",
      "you say to him: 'I don't know'? You cannot but know, since the Lord God\n",
      "in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child will ask you:\n",
      "'What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?' What will you say to him\n",
      "when you know nothing? How will you answer him? Will you leave him to\n",
      "the allurements of the world and the devil? That's not right,\" he said,\n",
      "and he stopped, putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with\n",
      "his kindly, gentle eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to enter\n",
      "upon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever\n",
      "asked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those\n",
      "questions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are entering upon a time of life,\" pursued the priest, \"when you\n",
      "must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that He may in His\n",
      "mercy aid you and have mercy on you!\" he concluded. \"Our Lord and God,\n",
      "Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His lovingkindness,\n",
      "forgives this child...\" and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the\n",
      "priest blessed him and dismissed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the\n",
      "awkward position being over and having been got through without his\n",
      "having to tell a lie. Apart from this, there remained a vague memory\n",
      "that what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so\n",
      "stupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it\n",
      "that must be cleared up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, not now,\" thought Levin, \"but some day later on.\" Levin felt\n",
      "more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in\n",
      "his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same position\n",
      "which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for which he\n",
      "blamed his friend Sviazhsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly's, and was in very\n",

      "in which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being\n",
      "trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there's such a chaos in your heart just now that you can't find\n",

      "a little, you'll find it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling\" (he\n",
      "could not say love before them) \"and happiness, a certain regret at\n",
      "losing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at the very loss of my\n",
      "freedom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Awful! It's a hopeless case!\" said Katavasov. \"Well, let's drink to his\n",
      "recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be\n",

      "When he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor\n",
      "friends, Levin asked himself: had he in his heart that regret for his\n",
      "freedom of which they had spoken? He smiled at the question. \"Freedom!\n",
      "What is freedom for? Happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes,\n",
      "thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at all--that's\n",
      "happiness!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?\" some voice suddenly\n",
      "whispered to him. The smile died away from his face, and he grew\n",
      "thoughtful. And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him. There came\n",
      "over him a dread and doubt--doubt of everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if she does not love me? What if she's marrying me simply to be\n",
      "married? What if she doesn't see herself what she's doing?\" he asked\n",
      "himself. \"She may come to her senses, and only when she is being married\n",
      "realize that she does not and cannot love me.\" And strange, most evil\n",
      "thoughts of her began to come to him. He was jealous of Vronsky, as he\n",
      "had been a year ago, as though the evening he had seen her with Vronsky\n",
      "had been yesterday. He suspected she had not told him everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped up quickly. \"No, this can't go on!\" he said to himself in\n",
      "despair. \"I'll go to her; I'll ask her; I'll say for the last time: we\n",
      "are free, and hadn't we better stay so? Anything's better than endless\n",
      "misery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!\" With despair in his heart and bitter\n",
      "anger against all men, against himself, against her, he went out of the\n",
      "hotel and drove to her house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found her in one of the back rooms. She was sitting on a chest and\n",
      "making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of\n",
      "different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight. \"Kostya!\n",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch!\" (These latter days she used these names almost\n",
      "alternately.) \"I didn't expect you! I'm going through my wardrobe to see\n",
      "what's for whom...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh! that's very nice!\" he said gloomily, looking at the maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can go, Dunyasha, I'll call you presently,\" said Kitty. \"Kostya,\n",
      "what's the matter?\" she asked, definitely adopting this familiar name as\n",
      "soon as the maid had gone out. She noticed his strange face, agitated\n",
      "and gloomy, and a panic came over her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kitty! I'm in torture. I can't suffer alone,\" he said with despair in\n",
      "his voice, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes. He\n",
      "saw already from her loving, truthful face, that nothing could come of\n",
      "what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself.\n",
      "\"I've come to say that there's still time. This can all be stopped and\n",

      "little. You've made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. You can't love\n",
      "me.... If ... better say so,\" he said, not looking at her. \"I shall be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, if you don't love me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're out of your mind!\" she cried, turning crimson with vexation. But\n",
      "his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging\n",
      "some clothes off an arm-chair, she sat down beside him. \"What are you\n",

      "When the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them\n",
      "completely reconciled. Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved\n",

      "for--as to explain what for. She told him that she loved him because she\n",
      "understood him completely, because she knew what he would like, and\n",
      "because everything he liked was good. And this seemed to him perfectly\n",
      "clear. When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on\n",
      "the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty's wanting to\n",
      "give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed\n",

      "everything was shut up--it was Sunday. They sent to Stepan\n",

      "maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in\n",

      "arm--till he understood at last that what he had to do was, without\n",

      "look down upon Vronsky's interests and calling in life. Hence Vronsky\n",
      "had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to\n",
      "assume, the meaning of which was: \"You may like or dislike my way of\n",

      "have to treat me with respect if you want to know me.\" Golenishtchev had\n",

      "second meeting might have been expected, one would have supposed, to\n",

      "bored he was. He forgot the disagreeable impression of their last\n",

      "\"Yes, he's a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly,\"\n",

      "behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which\n",
      "life is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding\n",
      "allusions and unpleasant questions. They assumed an air of fully\n",
      "comprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and\n",
      "even approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for\n",
      "to put all this into words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and\n",
      "therefore was doubly pleased to see him. And in fact, Golenishtchev's\n",
      "manner to Madame Karenina, when he was taken to call on her, was all\n",
      "that Vronsky could have desired. Obviously without the slightest effort\n",
      "he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never met Anna before, and was struck by her beauty, and still\n",
      "more by the frankness with which she accepted her position. She blushed\n",
      "when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he was extremely charmed by\n",
      "this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face. But what\n",
      "he liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on purpose\n",
      "that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she called\n",
      "Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house they had\n",
      "just taken, what was here called a palazzo. Golenishtchev liked this\n",
      "direct and simple attitude to her own position. Looking at Anna's manner\n",
      "of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey Alexandrovitch\n",
      "and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly. He\n",
      "fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand:\n",
      "how it was that, having made her husband wretched, having abandoned him\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I tell you what: it's a lovely day, let's go and have another look at\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I shall be very glad to; I'll go and put on my hat. Would you say it's\n",
      "hot?\" she said, stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at\n",
      "Vronsky. And again a vivid flush overspread her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared\n",
      "to be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he would\n",

      "\n",

      "thing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well then,\" Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort; \"so\n",

      "will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions. We\n",

      "\n",
      "Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the\n",
      "first part of the _Two Elements_, of which the author spoke as something\n",
      "well known. But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and\n",
      "Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the _Two Elements_,\n",
      "he listened to him with some interest, for Golenishtchev spoke well. But\n",
      "Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which\n",
      "Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him. As he went on\n",
      "talking, his eyes glittered more and more angrily; he was more and more\n",
      "hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents, and his face grew more\n",
      "and more excited and worried. Remembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively,\n",
      "good-natured and well-bred boy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky\n",
      "could not make out the reason of his irritability, and he did not like\n",
      "it. What he particularly disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man\n",
      "belonging to a good set, should put himself on a level with some\n",
      "scribbling fellows, with whom he was irritated and angry. Was it worth\n",
      "it? Vronsky disliked it, yet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and\n",
      "was sorry for him. Unhappiness, almost mental derangement, was visible\n",
      "on his mobile, rather handsome face, while without even noticing Anna's\n",
      "coming in, he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anna came in in her hat and cape, and her lovely hand rapidly\n",
      "swinging her parasol, and stood beside him, it was with a feeling of\n",
      "relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev\n",
      "which fastened persistently upon him, and with a fresh rush of love\n",
      "looked at his charming companion, full of life and happiness.\n",
      "Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was\n",
      "dejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone\n",
      "as she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and\n",
      "lively manner. After trying various subjects of conversation, she got\n",
      "him upon painting, of which he talked very well, and she listened to him\n",
      "attentively. They walked to the house they had taken, and looked over\n",

      "on their way back, \"Alexey will have a capital _atelier_. You must\n",

      "affectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would\n",
      "become intimate with them in their isolation, and that there was no need\n",
      "of reserve before him.\n",

      "thought of her husband's unhappiness did not poison her happiness. On\n",
      "one side that memory was too awful to be thought of. On the other side\n",
      "her husband's unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be\n",
      "regretted. The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her\n",

      "wound, his visit, the preparations for divorce, the departure from her\n",
      "husband's house, the parting from her son--all that seemed to her like a\n",
      "delirious dream, from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad.\n",

      "like repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has\n",
      "shaken off another man clinging to him. That man did drown. It was an\n",
      "evil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better\n",
      "not to brood over these fearful facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the\n",
      "first moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled all the\n",
      "past, she remembered that one reflection. \"I have inevitably made that\n",
      "man wretched,\" she thought; \"but I don't want to profit by his misery. I\n",
      "too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above\n",
      "everything--I am losing my good name and my son. I have done wrong, and\n",
      "so I don't want happiness, I don't want a divorce, and shall suffer from\n",

      "had meant to suffer, she was not suffering. Shame there was not. With\n",
      "the tact of which both had such a large share, they had succeeded in\n",
      "avoiding Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves in a\n",
      "false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended that\n",
      "they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than they\n",
      "did themselves. Separation from the son she loved--even that did not\n",
      "cause her anguish in these early days. The baby girl--_his_ child--was\n",
      "so sweet, and had so won Anna's heart, since she was all that was left\n",
      "her, that Anna rarely thought of her son.\n",

      "The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so\n",

      "felt unpardonably happy. The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she\n",
      "loved him. She loved him for himself, and for his love for her. Her\n",
      "complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her. His presence was\n",
      "always sweet to her. All the traits of his character, which she learned\n",
      "to know better and better, were unutterably dear to her. His appearance,\n",
      "changed by his civilian dress, was as fascinating to her as though she\n",
      "were some young girl in love. In everything he said, thought, and did,\n",
      "she saw something particularly noble and elevated. Her adoration of him\n",
      "alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find in him anything not\n",
      "fine. She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside\n",
      "him. It seemed to her that, knowing this, he might sooner cease to love\n",
      "her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love, though she\n",
      "had no grounds for fearing it. But she could not help being grateful to\n",
      "him for his attitude to her, and showing that she appreciated it. He,\n",
      "who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career, in\n",
      "which he would have been certain to play a leading part--he had\n",
      "sacrificed his ambition for her sake, and never betrayed the slightest\n",
      "regret. He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever, and the\n",
      "constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position\n",
      "never deserted him for a single instant. He, so manly a man, never\n",

      "which he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love,--and he\n",

      "supper with bachelor friends. Relations with the society of the\n",

      "stop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon it\n",
      "the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for\n",

      "an artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to\n",
      "select--religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting--he set to\n",
      "work to paint. He appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired by\n",

      "nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired directly\n",
      "by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is painted will\n",
      "belong to any recognized school. Since he knew nothing of this, and drew\n",

      "man who had been brought up in ideas of religion, law, and morality, and\n",
      "only through conflict and struggle came to free-thought; but now there\n",
      "has sprung up a new type of born free-thinkers who grow up without even\n",
      "having heard of principles of morality or of religion, of the existence\n",

      "have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and\n",
      "tragedians and historiaris and philosophers, and, you know, all the\n",
      "intellectual work that came in his way. But in our day he goes straight\n",

      "conflict with authorities, with the creeds of the ages; he would have\n",
      "perceived from this conflict that there was something else; but now he\n",
      "comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even\n",
      "furnish matter for discussion, but it is stated baldly that there is\n",

      "\n",
      "Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill\n",
      "with him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife. \"Oh! damn them\n",
      "all!\" he thought as he went on working. He was making a sketch for the\n",
      "figure of a man in a violent rage. A sketch had been made before, but he\n",
      "was dissatisfied with it. \"No, that one was better ... where is it?\" He\n",
      "went back to his wife, and scowling, and not looking at her, asked his\n",
      "eldest little girl, where was that piece of paper he had given them? The\n",
      "paper with the discarded sketch on it was found, but it was dirty, and\n",
      "spotted with candle-grease. Still, he took the sketch, laid it on his\n",
      "table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his eyes, he fell to\n",
      "gazing at it. All at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it! that's it!\" he said, and, at once picking up the pencil, he\n",
      "began rapidly drawing. The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled the face of\n",
      "a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a\n",
      "prominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this chin on to the\n",
      "figure of the man. He laughed aloud with delight. The figure from a\n",
      "lifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never\n",
      "be changed. That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably defined.\n",
      "The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the\n",
      "figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put differently, and the\n",
      "position of the left hand must be quite altered; the hair too might be\n",
      "thrown back. But in making these corrections he was not altering the\n",
      "figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure. He was, as\n",
      "it were, stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being\n",
      "distinctly seen. Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in\n",
      "all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of\n",

      "Of his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had at the\n",
      "bottom of his heart one conviction--that no one had ever painted a\n",

      "that picture, no one ever had conveyed. This he knew positively, and had\n",
      "known a long while, ever since he had begun to paint it. But other\n",
      "people's criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense consequence\n",
      "in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his soul. Any\n",
      "remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic saw even the\n",
      "tiniest part of what he saw in the picture, agitated him to the depths\n",
      "of his soul. He always attributed to his critics a more profound\n",
      "comprehension than he had himself, and always expected from them\n",
      "something he did not himself see in the picture. And often in their\n",
      "criticisms he fancied that he had found this.\n",

      "He walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of his\n",

      "in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was eagerly\n",

      "on this impression and absorbed it, as he had the chin of the shopkeeper\n",
      "who had sold him the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be brought out\n",
      "when he wanted it. The visitors, not agreeably impressed beforehand by\n",
      "Golenishtchev's account of the artist, were still less so by his\n",
      "personal appearance. Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble\n",

      "trousers--though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion,--most\n",
      "of all, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined\n",
      "expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov made\n",
      "an unpleasant impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please step in,\" he said, trying to look indifferent, and going into\n",

      "his jaws. Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting\n",
      "materials, although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the\n",
      "moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he rapidly and subtly\n",
      "formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of these three persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "That fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here. Mihailov did not\n",
      "remember his surname nor where he had met him, nor what he had said to\n",
      "him. He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had\n",
      "ever seen; but he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by\n",
      "in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor\n",
      "in expression. The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an\n",
      "appearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression--a\n",
      "petty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above the bridge\n",
      "of the narrow nose. Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be, Mihailov\n",
      "supposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing nothing about art,\n",
      "like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as amateurs and\n",
      "connoisseurs. \"Most likely they've already looked at all the antiques,\n",
      "and now they're making the round of the studios of the new people, the\n",
      "German humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have\n",
      "only come to me to make the point of view complete,\" he thought. He was\n",
      "well acquainted with the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were the\n",
      "worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary artists\n",
      "with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing\n",
      "of the past, and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees\n",
      "how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained. He\n",
      "expected all this; he saw it all in their faces, he saw it in the\n",
      "careless indifference with which they talked among themselves, stared at\n",
      "the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely fashion,\n",
      "waiting for him to uncover his picture. But in spite of this, while he\n",
      "was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking off the\n",
      "sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of his\n",
      "conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to\n",
      "be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture\n",
      "in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an\n",
      "outsider. For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a\n",
      "higher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very\n",
      "visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before. He forgot all he\n",
      "had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been\n",
      "painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely\n",
      "certain to him--he saw the picture with their indifferent, new, outside\n",
      "eyes, and saw nothing good in it. He saw in the foreground Pilate's\n",
      "irritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the background the\n",
      "figures of Pilate's retinue and the face of John watching what was\n",
      "happening. Every face that, with such agony, such blunders and\n",
      "corrections had grown up within him with its special character, every\n",
      "face that had given him such torments and such raptures, and all these\n",
      "faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole,\n",
      "all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such\n",
      "labor--all of this together seemed to him now, looking at it with their\n",
      "eyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been done a thousand\n",
      "times over. The face dearest to him, the face of Christ, the center of\n",
      "the picture, which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to\n",
      "him, was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their\n",
      "eyes. He saw a well-painted (no, not even that--he distinctly saw now a\n",
      "mass of defects) repetition of those endless Christs of Titian, Raphael,\n",
      "Rubens, and the same soldiers and Pilate. It was all common, poor, and\n",
      "stale, and positively badly painted--weak and unequal. They would be\n",
      "justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of\n",
      "the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too\n",
      "intolerable to him. To break it, and to show he was not agitated, he\n",
      "made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think I've had the pleasure of meeting you,\" he said, looking\n",
      "uneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any shade of\n",
      "their expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure! We met at Rossi's, do you remember, at that _soiree_ when\n",
      "that Italian lady recited--the new Rachel?\" Golenishtchev answered\n",
      "easily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture\n",
      "and turning to the artist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the\n",
      "picture, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and what\n",
      "strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of Pilate.\n",
      "One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an official\n",
      "through and through, who does not know what it is he's doing. But I\n",
      "fancy...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All Mihailov's mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled. He tried\n",
      "to say something, but he could not speak for excitement, and pretended\n",
      "to be coughing. Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev's capacity for\n",
      "understanding art, trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of\n",
      "the expression of Pilate as an official, and offensive as might have\n",
      "seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was\n",
      "said of more serious points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at\n",
      "this observation. He had himself thought about Pilate's figure just what\n",
      "Golenishtchev said. The fact that this reflection was but one of\n",
      "millions of reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be\n",
      "true, did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev's\n",
      "remark. His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a\n",
      "state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy. At once the whole of\n",
      "his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of\n",
      "everything living. Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he\n",
      "understood Pilate, but his lips quivered intractably, and he could not\n",
      "pronounce the words. Vronsky and Anna too said something in that subdued\n",
      "voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist's feelings and partly\n",
      "to avoid saying out loud something silly--so easily said when talking of\n",
      "art--people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures. Mihailov fancied\n",
      "that the picture had made an impression on them too. He went up to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How marvelous Christ's expression is!\" said Anna. Of all she saw she\n",
      "liked that expression most of all, and she felt that it was the center\n",
      "of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.\n",
      "\"One can see that He is pitying Pilate.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found\n",
      "in his picture and in the figure of Christ. She said that He was pitying\n",
      "Pilate. In Christ's expression there ought to be indeed an expression of\n",
      "pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly peace, of\n",
      "readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words. Of course there\n",
      "is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in Christ, seeing\n",
      "that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the\n",
      "spiritual life. All this and much more flashed into Mihailov's thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and how that figure is done--what atmosphere! One can walk round\n",
      "it,\" said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this remark that he\n",
      "did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there's a wonderful mastery!\" said Vronsky. \"How those figures in\n",
      "the background stand out! There you have technique,\" he said, addressing\n",
      "Golenishtchev, alluding to a conversation between them about Vronsky's\n",
      "despair of attaining this technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, marvelous!\" Golenishtchev and Anna assented. In spite of the\n",
      "excited condition in which he was, the sentence about technique had sent\n",
      "a pang to Mihailov's heart, and looking angrily at Vronsky he suddenly\n",
      "scowled. He had often heard this word technique, and was utterly unable\n",
      "to understand what was understood by it. He knew that by this term was\n",
      "understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing, entirely apart\n",
      "from its subject. He had noticed often that even in actual praise\n",
      "technique was opposed to essential quality, as though one could paint\n",
      "well something that was bad. He knew that a great deal of attention and\n",
      "care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid injuring the\n",
      "creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but there was no art\n",
      "of painting--no technique of any sort--about it. If to a little child or\n",
      "to his cook were revealed what he saw, it or she would have been able to\n",
      "peel the wrappings off what was seen. And the most experienced and\n",
      "adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if\n",
      "the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first. Besides, he saw\n",
      "that if it came to talking about technique, it was impossible to praise\n",
      "him for it. In all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt\n",
      "his eyes, coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings--faults\n",
      "he could not correct now without spoiling the whole. And in almost all\n",
      "the figures and faces he saw, too, remnants of the wrappings not\n",
      "perfectly removed that spoiled the picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark...\"\n",
      "observed Golenishtchev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,\" said Mihailov with a forced\n",

      "the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brother's\n",
      "visit in the autumn. He had expected to find the physical signs of the\n",
      "approach of death more marked--greater weakness, greater emaciation, but\n",
      "still almost the same condition of things. He had expected himself to\n",

      "\"You did not expect to find me like this,\" he articulated with effort.\n",

      "especially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared without\n",
      "dropping his eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each\n",
      "word. Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him. Nikolay\n",
      "expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid of frightening her by his\n",
      "condition. A silence followed. Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and began to\n",
      "say something. Levin expected something of peculiar gravity and\n",
      "importance from the expression of his face, but Nikolay began speaking\n",
      "of his health. He found fault with the doctor, regretting he had not a\n",
      "celebrated Moscow doctor. Levin saw that he still hoped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape, if\n",

      "he was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade\n",
      "her not to go in to the sick man. \"Why should she suffer as I am\n",

      "Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him a\n",

      "she went quickly to the sick man's bedside, and going up so that he had\n",

      "\n",

      "eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he did not see and\n",
      "did not distinguish the details of his brother's position. He smelt the\n",
      "awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition, and heard\n",
      "the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help. It never\n",
      "entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man's situation, to\n",
      "consider how that body was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated\n",

      "when he began to think of all these details. He was absolutely convinced\n",
      "that nothing could be done to prolong his brother's life or to relieve\n",
      "his suffering. But a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the\n",
      "question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him. And this made it\n",
      "still more painful for Levin. To be in the sick-room was agony to him,\n",
      "not to be there still worse. And he was continually, on various\n",
      "pretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was\n",
      "unable to remain alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently. On seeing the\n",

      "at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her\n",
      "husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,\n",
      "and to remedy them. And since she had not the slightest doubt that it\n",
      "was her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,\n",
      "and immediately set to work. The very details, the mere thought of which\n",
      "reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention. She\n",
      "sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist's, set the maid who had come\n",
      "with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she herself\n",
      "washed up something, washed out something else, laid something under the\n",
      "quilt. Something was by her directions brought into the sick-room,\n",
      "something else was carried out. She herself went several times to her\n",
      "room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got out and brought\n",

      "\n",
      "The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining\n",

      "with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her. Levin did\n",
      "not approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to\n",
      "the patient. Above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it. But\n",
      "the sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not\n",
      "angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what\n",
      "she was doing with him. Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had\n",
      "sent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the\n",
      "instant when, by Kitty's directions, they were changing his linen. The\n",
      "long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades\n",
      "and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the\n",
      "waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not\n",
      "get the long, limp arm into it. Kitty, hurriedly closing the door after\n",
      "Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and she moved\n",
      "rapidly towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Make haste,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, don't you come,\" said the sick man angrily. \"I'll do it my\n",

      "\"What say?\" queried Marya Nikolaevna. But Kitty heard and saw he was\n",
      "ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not looking, I'm not looking!\" she said, putting the arm in. \"Marya\n",

      "\n",
      "Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably\n",
      "and everything about him completely changed. The heavy smell was\n",
      "replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting lips\n",
      "and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe. There\n",
      "was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside. On the\n",
      "table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the\n",
      "linen needed was folded up there, and Kitty's _broderie anglaise_. On\n",
      "the other table by the patient's bed there were candles and drink and\n",
      "powders. The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on\n",
      "high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar about\n",
      "his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope looked\n",
      "fixedly at Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the\n",
      "one who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was\n",
      "dissatisfied with him. The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded\n",
      "the patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme\n",
      "minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet\n",
      "was to be kept to. He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer\n",
      "water, with warm milk at a certain temperature. When the doctor had gone\n",
      "away the sick man said something to his brother, of which Levin could\n",
      "distinguish only the last words: \"Your Katya.\" By the expression with\n",
      "which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he was praising her. He called\n",
      "indeed to Katya, as he called her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm much better already,\" he said. \"Why, with you I should have got\n",
      "well long ago. How nice it is!\" he took her hand and drew it towards his\n",
      "lips, but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind, let\n",
      "it go, and only stroked it. Kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood. She\n",
      "understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what\n",
      "he needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the other side,\" she said to her husband, \"he always sleeps on that\n",
      "side. Turn him over, it's so disagreeable calling the servants. I'm not\n",

      "nothing, under his wife's influence he made his resolute face that she\n",
      "knew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body,\n",
      "but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness\n",
      "of those powerless limbs. While he was turning him over, conscious of\n",
      "the huge emaciated arm about his neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly\n",
      "turned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man's head,\n",

      "a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made,\n",
      "brushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins were spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now,\n",
      "and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly. She\n",

      "\n",

      "of them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she performed\n",
      "all the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on,\n",
      "always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so. In spite\n",
      "of his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was\n",
      "as much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that he\n",
      "said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he\n",
      "would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch holes,\n",

      "You are such purity that....\" He took her hand and did not kiss it (to\n",
      "kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper); he\n",
      "merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her brightening eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would have been miserable for you to be alone,\" she said, and\n",
      "lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted\n",

      "The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.\n",
      "During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently. His great eyes,\n",
      "fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with\n",
      "a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was\n",
      "awful to Levin to see it. Levin knew that this passionate prayer and\n",
      "hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so\n",
      "loved. Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew\n",
      "that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith,\n",
      "but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific\n",
      "interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of\n",
      "faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one,\n",
      "brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a\n",
      "temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.\n",
      "Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the\n",
      "marvelous recoveries she had heard of. Levin knew all this; and it was\n",
      "agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and\n",
      "the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the\n",
      "cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping\n",
      "chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man\n",
      "was praying for. During the sacrament Levin did what he, an unbeliever,\n",
      "had done a thousand times. He said, addressing God, \"If Thou dost exist,\n",
      "make this man to recover\" (of course this same thing has been repeated\n",
      "many times), \"and Thou wilt save him and me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better. He did\n",
      "not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty's hand,\n",
      "thanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from pain,\n",
      "and that he felt strong and had an appetite. He even raised himself when\n",
      "his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well. Hopelessly ill as\n",
      "he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover,\n",
      "Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement,\n",
      "happy, though fearful of being mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is he better?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, much.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"There's nothing wonderful in it.\"\n",

      "\"Anyway, he's better,\" they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "This self-deception was not of long duration. The sick man fell into a\n",
      "quiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough. And\n",
      "all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself. The\n",
      "reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in the\n",
      "sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as\n",
      "though ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a\n",
      "bottle covered with perforated paper. Levin gave him the bottle, and the\n",
      "same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was\n",
      "now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of the\n",
      "doctor's words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is Katya not here?\" he gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly\n",
      "assented to the doctor's words. \"No; so I can say it.... It was for her\n",
      "sake I went through that farce. She's so sweet; but you and I can't\n",
      "deceive ourselves. This is what I believe in,\" he said, and, squeezing\n",
      "the bottle in his bony hand, he began breathing over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eight o'clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in\n",
      "their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly. She was\n",
      "pale, and her lips were quivering. \"He is dying!\" she whispered. \"I'm\n",
      "afraid will die this minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them ran to him. He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the\n",
      "bed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you feel?\" Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel I'm setting off,\" Nikolay said with difficulty, but with extreme\n",
      "distinctness, screwing the words out of himself. He did not raise his\n",
      "head, but simply turned his eyes upwards, without their reaching his\n",
      "brother's face. \"Katya, go away!\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm setting off,\" he said again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you think so?\" said Levin, so as to say something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I'm setting off,\" he repeated, as though he had a liking for\n",
      "the phrase. \"It's the end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marya Nikolaevna went up to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You had better lie down; you'd be easier,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall lie down soon enough,\" he pronounced slowly, \"when I'm dead,\"\n",
      "he said sarcastically, wrathfully. \"Well, you can lay me down if you\n",
      "like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at\n",
      "his face, holding his breath. The dying man lay with closed eyes, but\n",
      "the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one\n",
      "thinking deeply and intensely. Levin involuntarily thought with him of\n",
      "what it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his\n",
      "mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that\n",
      "calm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and\n",
      "clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, so,\" the dying man articulated slowly at intervals. \"Wait a\n",
      "little.\" He was silent. \"Right!\" he pronounced all at once reassuringly,\n",
      "as though all were solved for him. \"O Lord!\" he murmured, and sighed\n",
      "deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet. \"They're getting cold,\" she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man lay\n",
      "motionless. But he was still alive, and from time to time he sighed.\n",
      "Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain. He felt that, with no\n",
      "mental effort, could he understand what it was that was _right_. He\n",
      "could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of\n",
      "his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing\n",
      "the dead man's eyes, dressing him, ordering the coffin. And, strange to\n",
      "say, he felt utterly cold, and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss,\n",
      "less still of pity for his brother. If he had any feeling for his\n",
      "brother at that moment, it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had\n",
      "now that he could not have.\n",
      "\n",
      "A long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end. But\n",
      "the end did not come. The door opened and Kitty appeared. Levin got up\n",
      "to stop her. But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound of\n",
      "the dying man stirring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't go away,\" said Nikolay and held out his hand. Levin gave him his,\n",
      "and angrily waved to his wife to go away.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the dying man's hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an hour,\n",
      "another hour. He did not think of death at all now. He wondered what\n",
      "Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor lived in\n",
      "a house of his own. He longed for food and for sleep. He cautiously drew\n",
      "away his hand and felt the feet. The feet were cold, but the sick man\n",
      "was still breathing. Levin tried again to move away on tiptoe, but the\n",
      "sick man stirred again and said: \"Don't go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "                                  ----\n",
      "\n",
      "The dawn came; the sick man's condition was unchanged. Levin stealthily\n",
      "withdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to his\n",
      "own room and went to sleep. When he woke up, instead of news of his\n",
      "brother's death which he expected, he learned that the sick man had\n",
      "returned to his earlier condition. He had begun sitting up again,\n",
      "coughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased to\n",
      "talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his recovery, and had\n",
      "become more irritable and more gloomy than ever. No one, neither his\n",
      "brother nor Kitty, could soothe him. He was angry with everyone, and\n",
      "said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his sufferings,\n",
      "and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from Moscow.\n",
      "To all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the same answer\n",
      "with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness, \"I'm suffering\n",
      "horribly, intolerably!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores,\n",
      "which it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry with\n",
      "everyone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially for not\n",
      "having brought him a doctor from Moscow. Kitty tried in every possible\n",
      "way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and Levin saw\n",
      "that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though she\n",
      "would not admit it. The sense of death, which had been evoked in all by\n",
      "his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother,\n",
      "was broken up. Everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon, that he\n",
      "was half dead already. Everyone wished for nothing but that he should\n",
      "die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing this, gave him\n",
      "medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and deceived him and\n",
      "themselves and each other. All this was falsehood, disgusting,\n",
      "irreverent deceit. And owing to the bent of his character, and because\n",
      "he loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was most\n",
      "painfully conscious of this deceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his\n",
      "brothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, and having received an answer from him, he read this letter\n",
      "to the sick man. Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself,\n",
      "and in touching terms he begged his brother's forgiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sick man said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What am I to write to him?\" said Levin. \"I hope you are not angry with\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, not the least!\" Nikolay answered, vexed at the question. \"Tell him\n",
      "to send me a doctor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same\n",
      "condition. The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now\n",
      "at the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all\n",
      "the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna and\n",
      "Levin and Kitty. The sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on\n",
      "the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and went on\n",
      "taking medicine and talking of life. Only at rare moments, when the\n",
      "opium gave him an instant's relief from the never-ceasing pain, he would\n",
      "sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his heart\n",
      "than in all the others: \"Oh, if it were only the end!\" or: \"When will it\n",
      "be over?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and\n",
      "prepared him for death. There was no position in which he was not in\n",
      "pain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it, not a\n",
      "limb, not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony. Even\n",
      "the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened in him\n",
      "now the same aversion as the body itself. The sight of other people,\n",
      "their remarks, his own reminiscences, everything was for him a source of\n",
      "agony. Those about him felt this, and instinctively did not allow\n",
      "themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes before him.\n",
      "All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be\n",
      "rid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him\n",
      "look upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness. Hitherto each\n",
      "individual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger,\n",
      "fatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving\n",
      "pleasure. But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and\n",
      "the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering. And so all\n",
      "desires were merged in one--the desire to be rid of all his sufferings\n",
      "and their source, the body. But he had no words to express this desire\n",
      "of deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for\n",
      "the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied. \"Turn me\n",
      "over on the other side,\" he would say, and immediately after he would\n",
      "ask to be turned back again as before. \"Give me some broth. Take away\n",
      "the broth. Talk of something: why are you silent?\" And directly they\n",
      "began to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness,\n",
      "indifference, and loathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell. She\n",
      "suffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the\n",
      "morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and\n",
      "excitement, and prescribed rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to\n",
      "the sick man. He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled\n",
      "contemptuously when she said she had been unwell. That day he was\n",
      "continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you feel?\" she asked him.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Everywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be over today, you will see,\" said Marya Nikolaevna. Though it\n",
      "was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin had noticed was\n",
      "very keen, must have heard. Levin said hush to her, and looked round at\n",
      "the sick man. Nikolay had heard; but these words produced no effect on\n",
      "him. His eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you think so?\" Levin asked her, when she had followed him into\n",
      "the corridor.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"How do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Like this,\" she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt. Levin\n",

      "were, trying to snatch something away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marya Nikolaevna's prediction came true. Towards night the sick man was\n",
      "not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the same\n",
      "intensely concentrated expression in his eyes. Even when his brother or\n",
      "Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked just the same.\n",
      "Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of\n",
      "life; his eyes were closed. Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at\n",
      "the bedside. The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when\n",
      "the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes. The priest, on\n",
      "finishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly\n",
      "returned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in\n",
      "silence, he touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is gone,\" said the priest, and would have moved away; but suddenly\n",
      "there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed\n",
      "glued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the\n",
      "bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not quite ... soon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the\n",
      "mustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying\n",
      "out the corpse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin\n",
      "that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the\n",
      "nearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him that autumn\n",
      "evening when his brother had come to him. This feeling was now even\n",
      "stronger than before; even less than before did he feel capable of\n",
      "apprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before\n",
      "him more terrible than ever. But now, thanks to his wife's presence,\n",
      "that feeling did not reduce him to despair. In spite of death, he felt\n",
      "the need of life and love. He felt that love saved him from despair, and\n",

      "enough, but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events\n",
      "prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had already been punished over\n",
      "this lesson. The passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything,\n",

      "where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the Flood. He did not know\n",
      "one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up alive to heaven. Last\n",
      "time he had remembered their names, but now he had forgotten them\n",
      "utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the personage he liked best in the\n",
      "whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch's translation to heaven was\n",
      "connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought, in which he\n",
      "became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father's\n",
      "watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned button on his waistcoat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved\n",
      "entirely. He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all\n",
      "that he himself would die. That was to him something utterly\n",
      "inconceivable and impossible. But he had been told that all men die; he\n",
      "had asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed\n",
      "it; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly. But Enoch had\n",
      "not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die. \"And why cannot\n",

      "to make a windmill on which he could turn himself--clutching at the\n",
      "sails or tying himself on and whirling round. Of his mother Seryozha did\n",
      "not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly\n",

      "\n",
      "Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a\n",
      "certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but\n",
      "it was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they\n",
      "talked about Anna's going to Vronsky's estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the\n",
      "new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange\n",
      "misapprehension. One would have thought he must have understood that\n",
      "society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung\n",
      "up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and\n",
      "that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously\n",
      "become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society\n",
      "had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in\n",
      "society was not a foregone conclusion. \"Of course,\" he thought, \"she\n",
      "would not be received at court, but intimate friends can and must look\n",
      "at it in the proper light.\" One may sit for several hours at a stretch\n",
      "with one's legs crossed in the same position, if one knows that there's\n",
      "nothing to prevent one's changing one's position; but if a man knows\n",
      "that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on,\n",
      "the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one\n",
      "would like to draw them. This was what Vronsky was experiencing in\n",
      "regard to the world. Though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the\n",
      "world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether the world had not\n",
      "changed by now and would not receive them. But he very quickly perceived\n",
      "that though the world was open for him personally, it was closed for\n",
      "Anna. Just as in the game of cat and mouse, the hands raised for him\n",
      "were dropped to bar the way for Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his\n",

      "you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find\n",

      "about the divorce? Is that all over?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky noticed that Betsy's enthusiasm waned when she learned that no\n",
      "divorce had as yet taken place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People will throw stones at me, I know,\" she said, \"but I shall come\n",
      "and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come. You won't be here long, I\n",
      "suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her tone was\n",
      "not at all the same as in former days. She unmistakably prided herself\n",
      "on her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her\n",
      "friendship. She only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and\n",
      "on leaving she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing I'm ready to\n",

      "From Betsy's tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from\n",
      "the world; but he made another effort in his own family. His mother he\n",

      "enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy\n",
      "on her now for having ruined her son's career. But he had more hope of\n",
      "Varya, his brother's wife. He fancied she would not throw stones, and\n",
      "would go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive her in her\n",
      "own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her alone,\n",
      "expressed his wishes directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know, Alexey,\" she said after hearing him, \"how fond I am of you,\n",

      "because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna,\" she\n",
      "said, articulating the name \"Anna Arkadyevna\" with particular care.\n",
      "\"Don't suppose, please, that I judge her. Never; perhaps in her place I\n",
      "should have done the same. I don't and can't enter into that,\" she said,\n",
      "glancing timidly at his gloomy face. \"But one must call things by their\n",
      "names. You want me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to\n",
      "rehabilitate her in society; but do understand that I _cannot_ do so. I\n",
      "have daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my husband's\n",
      "sake. Well, I'm ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she will\n",
      "understand that I can't ask her here, or I should have to do so in such\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do\n",

      "silence, understanding that his sister-in-law's decision was not to be\n",
      "shaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alexey! don't be angry with me. Please understand that I'm not to\n",
      "blame,\" began Varya, looking at him with a timid smile.\n",

      "not breaking up, at least weakening it. You will understand that for me,\n",
      "too, it cannot be otherwise.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to spend\n",
      "these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every\n",
      "sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to\n",
      "the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him. One of\n",
      "the most unpleasant features of his position in Petersburg was that\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere. He\n",
      "could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on\n",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting\n",
      "him. So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a\n",

      "sore finger on everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he\n",
      "perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand\n",
      "in Anna. At one time she would seem in love with him, and then she would\n",
      "become cold, irritable, and impenetrable. She was worrying over\n",
      "something, and keeping something back from him, and did not seem to\n",
      "notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence, and for her, with\n",

      "importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination. She did\n",
      "not even put to herself the question how to arrange it. It seemed to her\n",

      "any allusion to it she would begin to hate him. And she dreaded that\n",

      "them to me,\" she said, with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the\n",

      "\"In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to show\n",

      "that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not say that to her. \"But how can she fail to see it, and what\n",

      "him off with his fur coat, called him \"Your Excellency,\" and suggested\n",
      "he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor. In the\n",
      "brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and two\n",
      "attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors. Through\n",
      "the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet _staccato_\n",
      "accompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female voice rendering\n",
      "distinctly a musical phrase. The door opened to let the box-opener slip\n",
      "through, and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky's hearing\n",
      "clearly. But the doors were closed again at once, and Vronsky did not\n",
      "hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though\n",
      "he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over. When he entered\n",
      "the hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise\n",
      "was still going on. On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, with\n",
      "bare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was, with the help of the tenor\n",
      "who had given her his arm, gathering up the bouquets that were flying\n",
      "awkwardly over the footlights. Then she went up to a gentleman with\n",
      "glossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who was stretching across\n",
      "the footlights holding out something to her, and all the public in the\n",
      "stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement, craning forward,\n",
      "shouting and clapping. The conductor in his high chair assisted in\n",
      "passing the offering, and straightened his white tie. Vronsky walked\n",
      "into the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about\n",
      "him. That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar,\n",

      "uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater.\n",
      "\n",

      "worst, his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch. To his relief Alexey\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,\" answered\n",

      "\"What a pity you were not in time for the first act!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky, listening with one ear, moved his opera glass from the stalls\n",
      "and scanned the boxes. Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who\n",
      "seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera glass, Vronsky suddenly\n",
      "caught sight of Anna's head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and smiling in\n",
      "the frame of lace. She was in the fifth box, twenty paces from him. She\n",
      "was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to\n",
      "Yashvin. The setting of her head on her handsome, broad shoulders, and\n",
      "the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face\n",
      "reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow. But\n",
      "he felt utterly different towards her beauty now. In his feeling for her\n",
      "now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty, though it\n",
      "attracted him even more intensely than before, gave him now a sense of\n",
      "injury. She was not looking in his direction, but Vronsky felt that she\n",
      "had seen him already.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction, he noticed\n",
      "that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing\n",
      "unnaturally and looking round at the next box. Anna, folding her fan and\n",
      "tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and\n",
      "obviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.\n",
      "Yashvin's face wore the expression which was common when he was losing\n",
      "at cards. Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache further and\n",
      "further into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that box on the left were the Kartasovs. Vronsky knew them, and knew\n",
      "that Anna was acquainted with them. Madame Kartasova, a thin little\n",
      "woman, was standing up in her box, and, her back turned upon Anna, she\n",
      "was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her. Her face\n",
      "was pale and angry, and she was talking excitedly. Kartasov, a fat, bald\n",
      "man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he attempted to soothe\n",
      "his wife. When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a long while,\n",
      "and tried to catch Anna's eye, obviously anxious to bow to her. But\n",
      "Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and talked to\n",
      "Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her. Kartasov went out\n",
      "without making his salutation, and the box was left empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the\n",
      "Kartasovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had\n",
      "happened. He knew this both from what he had seen, and most of all from\n",
      "the face of Anna, who, he could see, was taxing every nerve to carry\n",
      "through the part she had taken up. And in maintaining this attitude of\n",
      "external composure she was completely successful. Anyone who did not\n",
      "know her and her circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the\n",
      "women expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she\n",
      "should show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with\n",
      "her lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness\n",
      "of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations\n",
      "of a man in the stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what,\n",
      "Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out\n",
      "something, he went towards his brother's box. Purposely choosing the way\n",
      "round furthest from Anna's box, he jostled as he came out against the\n",
      "colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances. Vronsky heard\n",
      "the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel hastened to\n",
      "address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Vronsky! When are you coming to the regiment? We can't let you off\n",
      "without a supper. You're one of the old set,\" said the colonel of his\n",
      "regiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't stop, awfully sorry, another time,\" said Vronsky, and he ran\n",
      "upstairs towards his brother's box.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old countess, Vronsky's mother, with her steel-gray curls, was in\n",
      "his brother's box. Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in the\n",
      "corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varya held out her hand\n",
      "to her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what interested\n",

      "\n",

      "\"But what did she do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her husband\n",
      "began talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.\n",
      "She said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count, your maman is asking for you,\" said the young Princess Sorokina,\n",
      "peeping out of the door of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've been expecting you all the while,\" said his mother, smiling\n",
      "sarcastically. \"You were nowhere to be seen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good evening, maman. I have come to you,\" he said coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why aren't you going to _faire la cour a Madame Karenina?_\" she went\n",
      "on, when Princess Sorokina had moved away. \"_Elle fait sensation. On\n",
      "oublie la Patti pour elle_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,\" he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm only saying what everyone's saying.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, Alexey!\" said his brother. \"How disgusting! Idiot of a woman,\n",
      "nothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let's go together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky did not hear him. With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt\n",
      "that he must do something, but he did not know what. Anger with her for\n",
      "having put herself and him in such a false position, together with pity\n",
      "for her suffering, filled his heart. He went down, and made straight for\n",
      "Anna's box. At her box stood Stremov, talking to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are no more tenors. _Le moule en est brise!_\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Noticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing\n",

      "\n",
      "Anna was already at home. When Vronsky went up to her, she was in the\n",

      "said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing. Kitty was the\n",
      "first to break the silence. She remembered all that last winter before\n",
      "her marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka's,\" she said, a\n",
      "natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point. \"I should have liked\n",

      "men, I mean,\" she added, \"awfully jealous over our past.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not all,\" said Dolly. \"You judge by your own husband. It makes him\n",

      "That Vronsky paid you attentions--that happens to every girl.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, let me speak,\" her mother went on, \"why, you yourself would not let\n",

      "\"There's no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... Your\n",

      "Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up. \"Is it all right in the new way?\"\n",

      "\"I don't know what to think,\" Levin answered, smiling. \"Sergey seems\n",
      "very strange to me in that way. I told you, you know...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and\n",
      "tradition. I remember him then. He was wonderfully sweet. But I've\n",
      "watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes, but\n",
      "one feels that to him they're simply people, not women.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but now with Varenka ... I fancy there's something...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps there is.... But one has to know him.... He's a peculiar,\n",
      "wonderful person. He lives a spiritual life only. He's too pure, too\n",
      "exalted a nature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why? Would this lower him, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but he's so used to a spiritual life that he can't reconcile\n",
      "himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without\n",
      "taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language. He knew that his\n",
      "wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what\n",
      "he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but there's not so much of that actual fact about her as about me.\n",
      "I can see that he would never have cared for me. She is altogether\n",
      "spiritual.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people\n",
      "like you....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's very nice to me; but...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each\n",
      "other,\" Levin finished. \"Why not speak of him?\" he added. \"I sometimes\n",
      "blame myself for not; it ends in one's forgetting. Ah, how terrible and\n",
      "dear he was!... Yes, what were we talking about?\" Levin said, after a\n",
      "pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You think he can't fall in love,\" said Kitty, translating into her own\n",
      "language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not so much that he can't fall in love,\" Levin said, smiling, \"but\n",
      "he has not the weakness necessary.... I've always envied him, and even\n",
      "now, when I'm so happy, I still envy him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You envy him for not being able to fall in love?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I envy him for being better than I,\" said Levin. \"He does not live for\n",
      "himself. His whole life is subordinated to his duty. And that's why he\n",
      "can be calm and contented.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you?\" Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile;\n",
      "but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother\n",
      "and abasing himself, was not quite sincere. Kitty knew that this\n",
      "insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame\n",
      "at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be\n",
      "better--she loved it in him, and so she smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you? What are you dissatisfied with?\" she asked, with the same\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and\n",
      "unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds\n",
      "of her disbelief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself...\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, how shall I say?... In my heart I really care for nothing\n",
      "whatever but that you should not stumble--see? Oh, but really you\n",
      "mustn't skip about like that!\" he cried, breaking off to scold her for\n",
      "too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.\n",
      "\"But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others,\n",
      "especially with my brother, I feel I'm a poor creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But in what way?\" Kitty pursued with the same smile. \"Don't you too\n",
      "work for others? What about your co-operative settlement, and your work\n",
      "on the estate, and your book?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now--it's your fault,\" he said,\n",
      "pressing her hand--\"that all that doesn't count. I do it in a way\n",
      "halfheartedly. If I could care for all that as I care for you!...\n",
      "Instead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what would you say about papa?\" asked Kitty. \"Is he a poor\n",
      "creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He?--no! But then one must have the simplicity, the\n",
      "straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven't got\n",
      "that. I do nothing, and I fret about it. It's all your doing. Before\n",
      "there was you--and _this_ too,\" he added with a glance towards her waist\n",
      "that she understood--\"I put all my energies into work; now I can't, and\n",
      "I'm ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I'm\n",
      "pretending....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey Ivanovitch?\"\n",
      "said Kitty. \"Would you like to do this work for the general good, and to\n",
      "love the task set you, as he does, and nothing else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Levin. \"But I'm so happy that I don't understand\n",
      "anything. So you think he'll make her an offer today?\" he added after a\n",
      "brief silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think so, and I don't think so. Only, I'm awfully anxious for it.\n",
      "Here, wait a minute.\" She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the\n",
      "edge of the path. \"Come, count: he does propose, he doesn't,\" she said,\n",
      "giving him the flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He does, he doesn't,\" said Levin, tearing off the white petals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no!\" Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him. She had been\n",
      "watching his fingers with interest. \"You picked off two.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, but see, this little one shan't count to make up,\" said Levin,\n",
      "tearing off a little half-grown petal. \"Here's the wagonette overtaking\n",

      "the man she cared for, was very attractive. Sergey Ivanovitch walked\n",

      "all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he\n",

      "only once, in his early youth. The feeling of happiness in being near\n",
      "her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a\n",

      "far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the\n",

      "out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower\n",
      "with its rosy red catkins. It was perfectly still all round him. Only\n",
      "overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of\n",
      "bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children's voices\n",
      "were floated across to him. All at once he heard, not far from the edge\n",
      "of the wood, the sound of Varenka's contralto voice, calling Grisha, and\n",
      "a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch's face. Conscious of\n",
      "this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and\n",
      "taking out a cigar, he began lighting it. For a long while he could not\n",
      "get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree. The soft scales\n",

      "uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards\n",
      "over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree. Watching the\n",
      "streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his\n",

      "_mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with\n",
      "the whole bent of my life--if I felt that in giving way to this\n",
      "attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it's not\n",
      "so. The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie, I\n",
      "said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory. That's the\n",

      "consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but\n",
      "would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of\n",
      "others. \"But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never\n",

      "freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she\n",

      "Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an\n",
      "unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew\n",
      "the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which\n",
      "were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch's conception of the woman\n",
      "who was to share his life. Thirdly: she was religious, and not like a\n",
      "child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, was, but\n",
      "her life was founded on religious principles. Even in trifling matters,\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife: she was\n",

      "united all these qualities, loved him. He was a modest man, but he could\n",
      "not help seeing it. And he loved her. There was one consideration\n",
      "against it--his age. But he came of a long-lived family, he had not a\n",
      "single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he\n",
      "remembered Varenka's saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty\n",
      "thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers\n",
      "himself _dans la force de l'age_, while a man of forty is _un jeune\n",

      "young in heart as he had been twenty years ago? Was it not youth to feel\n",
      "as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood\n",
      "he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure\n",
      "of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the\n",
      "trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of\n",
      "Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the\n",
      "yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the\n",
      "distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of\n",

      "To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame\n",

      "Now or never it must be said--that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.\n",
      "Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes\n",

      "\"And I know why,\" the princess went on; \"he says that young people ought\n",
      "to be left alone for a while at first.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But papa has left us alone. We've never seen him,\" said Kitty.\n",
      "\"Besides, we're not young people!--we're old, married people by now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only if he doesn't come, I shall say good-bye to you children,\" said\n",
      "the princess, sighing mournfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What nonsense, mamma!\" both the daughters fell upon her at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you suppose he is feeling? Why, now...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess's voice. Her\n",
      "daughters were silent, and looked at one another. \"Maman always finds\n",
      "something to be miserable about,\" they said in that glance. They did not\n",
      "know that happy as the princess was in her daughter's house, and useful\n",
      "as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely miserable, both\n",
      "on her own account and her husband's, ever since they had married their\n",
      "last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?\" Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea\n",
      "Mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of\n",
      "meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About supper.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's right,\" said Dolly; \"you go and arrange about it, and I'll\n",
      "go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing done\n",
      "all day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's my lesson! No, Dolly, I'm going,\" said Levin, jumping up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of\n",
      "the term in the summer holidays. Darya Alexandrovna, who had been\n",
      "studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on\n",
      "coming to the Levins' to go over with him, at least once a day, the most\n",
      "difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic. Levin had offered to take her\n",
      "place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin's lesson, and\n",
      "noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had\n",
      "given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety\n",
      "not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the\n",
      "teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.\n",
      "Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his\n",
      "duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had\n",
      "no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so\n",
      "badly. But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as\n",
      "she wished. And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by\n",
      "the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour\n",
      "of the lesson. So it had been today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm going, Dolly, you sit still,\" he said. \"We'll do it all\n",
      "properly, like the book. Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting,\n",
      "then we shall have to miss it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Levin went to Grisha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty. Even in the happy,\n",
      "well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making\n",
      "herself useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll see to the supper, you sit still,\" she said, and got up to go to\n",
      "Agafea Mihalovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, most likely they've not been able to get chickens. If so,\n",
      "ours...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,\" and Varenka vanished with\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a nice girl!\" said the princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not nice, maman; she's an exquisite girl; there's no one else like\n",
      "her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?\" said Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about\n",
      "Varenka. \"It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike than\n",
      "yours,\" he said with a subtle smile. \"One all movement, only living in\n",
      "society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively, alert,\n",
      "quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either sinks\n",
      "into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's very heedless,\" said the princess, addressing Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch. \"I've been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it's\n",
      "out of the question for her\" (she indicated Kitty) \"to stay here; that\n",
      "she positively must come to Moscow. He talks of getting a doctor\n",
      "down...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maman, he'll do everything; he has agreed to everything,\" Kitty said,\n",
      "angry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in\n",
      "such a matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses\n",
      "and the sound of wheels on the gravel. Dolly had not time to get up to\n",
      "go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where\n",
      "Grisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out\n",
      "after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Stiva!\" Levin shouted from under the balcony. \"We've finished,\n",
      "Dolly, don't be afraid!\" he added, and started running like a boy to\n",
      "meet the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_\" shouted Grisha, skipping along the\n",
      "avenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And some one else too! Papa, of course!\" cried Levin, stopping at the\n",
      "entrance of the avenue. \"Kitty, don't come down the steep staircase, go\n",
      "round.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage\n",
      "for the old prince. As he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a\n",
      "Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind. This was Vassenka\n",
      "Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young\n",
      "gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society. \"A capital fellow, and a\n",
      "keen sportsman,\" as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in\n",
      "place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming\n",
      "acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the\n",
      "carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had\n",
      "brought with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind. He was rather\n",
      "vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more\n",
      "the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka\n",
      "Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person. He seemed to him\n",
      "still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps\n",
      "where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in\n",
      "much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm\n",
      "and gallant air, kissing Kitty's hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,\" said Vassenka\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, are there plenty of birds?\" Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin,\n",
      "hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings. \"We've come\n",
      "with the most savage intentions. Why, maman, they've not been in Moscow\n",
      "since! Look, Tanya, here's something for you! Get it, please, it's in\n",
      "the carriage, behind!\" he talked in all directions. \"How pretty you've\n",
      "grown, Dolly,\" he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding\n",
      "it in one of his, and patting it with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now\n",
      "looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?\" he thought, looking at\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch's tender demonstrations to his wife. He looked at\n",
      "Dolly, and he did not like her either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She doesn't believe in his love. So what is she so pleased about?\n",
      "Revolting!\" thought Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before,\n",
      "and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka, with\n",
      "his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to\n",
      "him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor\n",
      "respected Oblonsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_\n",
      "making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was\n",
      "thinking of nothing but getting married.\n",
      "\n",
      "And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of\n",
      "gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as\n",
      "though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else. And, above all,\n",
      "unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were\n",
      "all seated, Levin turned and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband. She tried to seize a\n",
      "moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her,\n",
      "saying he was wanted at the counting-house. It was long since his own\n",
      "work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.\n",
      "\"It's all holiday for them,\" he thought; \"but these are no holiday\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted, we will go. And have you had any shooting yet\n",
      "this year?\" said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but\n",
      "speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him, and\n",
      "that was so out of keeping with him. \"I can't answer for our finding\n",
      "grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. Only we ought to start early.\n",
      "You're not tired? Aren't you tired, Stiva?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, do stay a little, Dolly,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going round to\n",

      "Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing\n",

      "an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky. And that was not all. He saw\n",
      "on his wife's face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed\n",

      "with great animation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's exceedingly nice at their place,\" Veslovsky was telling them about\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,\" said Dolly.\n",
      "\"I am sorry for her, and I know her. She's a splendid woman. I will go\n",

      "will be better indeed without you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch. \"And you, Kitty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I? Why should I go?\" Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced\n",
      "round at her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?\" Veslovsky asked her. \"She's a very\n",
      "fascinating woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more. She got up and\n",
      "walked across to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had\n",
      "overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far\n",
      "indeed. Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own fashion.\n",
      "Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at\n",
      "the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she\n",
      "cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka\n",
      "Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm going,\" he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won't see anything of\n",
      "her husband, and set off the day after,\" said Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motive of Kitty's words was interpreted by Levin thus: \"Don't\n",
      "separate me from _him_. I don't care about _your_ going, but do let me\n",
      "enjoy the society of this delightful young man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if you wish, we'll stay here tomorrow,\" Levin answered, with\n",
      "peculiar amiability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had\n",
      "occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with\n",
      "smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin saw that look. He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly\n",
      "breathe. \"How dare he look at my wife like that!\" was the feeling that\n",
      "boiled within him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrow, then? Do, please, let us go,\" said Vassenka, sitting down on\n",
      "a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin's jealousy went further still. Already he saw himself a deceived\n",
      "husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to\n",
      "provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life.... But in\n",
      "spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about\n",
      "his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up\n",
      "herself and advising Kitty to go to bed. But even at this point Levin\n",
      "could not escape another agony. As he said good-night to his hostess,\n",
      "Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew\n",
      "back her hand and said with a naive bluntness, for which the old\n",
      "princess scolded her afterwards:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't like that fashion.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Levin's eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to\n",
      "arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not\n",
      "like them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, how can one want to go to bed!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who,\n",
      "after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most\n",
      "charming and sentimental humor. \"Look, Kitty,\" he said, pointing to the\n",
      "moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees--\"how exquisite!\n",
      "Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. You know, he has a splendid\n",
      "voice; we practiced songs together along the road. He has brought some\n",
      "lovely songs with him, two new ones. Varvara Andreevna and he must sing\n",
      "some duets.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while\n",
      "about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one\n",
      "of the new songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife's\n",
      "bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was\n",
      "wrong. But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question:\n",
      "\"Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky?\"--it all\n",
      "burst out, and he told her all. He was humiliated himself at what he was\n",
      "saying, and that exasperated him all the more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his\n",
      "scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as\n",
      "though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in. The expression\n",
      "of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the\n",
      "same time had a look of suffering which touched her. His jaws were\n",
      "twitching, and his voice kept breaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You must understand that I'm not jealous, that's a nasty word. I can't\n",
      "be jealous, and believe that.... I can't say what I feel, but this is\n",
      "awful.... I'm not jealous, but I'm wounded, humiliated that anybody dare\n",
      "think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Eyes like what?\" said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to\n",
      "recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something\n",
      "precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other\n",
      "end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would\n",
      "have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so\n",
      "increase his suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah!\" he cried, clutching at his head, \"you shouldn't say that!... If\n",
      "you had been attractive then...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!\" she said, looking at\n",
      "him with an expression of pained commiseration. \"Why, what can you be\n",
      "thinking about! When for me there's no one in the world, no one, no\n",

      "spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space\n",

      "\"It will be much better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But where's your staircase coming out with its three steps?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, upon my word, sir,\" the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.\n",
      "\"It comes out right at the very spot. It starts, so to speak,\" he said,\n",

      "that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action.\n",
      "If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only the doubt\n",
      "whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska\n",

      "to him the day before. Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple,\n",
      "good-hearted, and very good-humored. If Levin had met him before he was\n",
      "married, he would have made friends with him. Levin rather disliked his\n",
      "holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of\n",
      "elegance. It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in\n",
      "himself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a\n",
      "stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be\n",
      "forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding. Levin liked\n",
      "him for his good education, for speaking French and English with such an\n",
      "excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don\n",
      "Steppes. He kept praising him enthusiastically. \"How fine it must be\n",
      "galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! Eh? isn't it?\" he said. He\n",
      "had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic,\n",
      "and it turned out nothing of the sort. But his simplicity, particularly\n",
      "in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and the grace of\n",
      "his movements, was very attractive. Either because his nature was\n",
      "sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins\n",
      "of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him,\n",
      "anyway he liked his society.\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once\n",
      "felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had\n",
      "lost them or left them on the table. In the pocketbook there were\n",
      "thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know what, Levin, I'll gallop home on that left trace-horse.\n",
      "That will be splendid. Eh?\" he said, preparing to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, why should you?\" answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could\n",
      "hardly weigh less than seventeen stone. \"I'll send the coachman.\"\n",

      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once\n",
      "detected reeds visible from the road.\n",

      "turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the marsh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! Come along, Levin, let's go together!\" Veslovsky called.\n",

      "\"Really, there's not room. Laska, back, Laska! You won't want another\n",
      "dog, will you?\"\n",

      "\"Oh, no, it was jolly all the same. Did you see us?\" said Vassenka\n",
      "Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his\n",
      "peewit in his hands. \"How splendidly I shot this bird! Didn't I? Well,\n",
      "shall we soon be getting to the real place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the\n",
      "stock of someone's gun, and there was the report of a shot. The gun did\n",
      "actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin. It appeared\n",
      "that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the\n",
      "other hammer still cocked. The charge flew into the ground without doing\n",
      "harm to anyone. Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed\n",
      "reprovingly at Veslovsky. But Levin had not the heart to reprove him. In\n",
      "the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by\n",
      "the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin's\n",
      "forehead. And besides, Veslovsky was at first so naively distressed, and\n",
      "then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay,\n",
      "that one could not but laugh with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would\n",
      "inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to\n",
      "pass it by. But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him. Again, as the marsh\n",
      "was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge. Vassenka Veslovsky was the\n",
      "first to run after the dog. Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come\n",
      "up, a grouse flew out. Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown\n",
      "meadow. This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up. Krak found it\n",
      "again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.\n",
      "\"Now you go and I'll stay with the horses,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman's envy. He handed the\n",

      "\n",
      "As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was\n",
      "more and more earnestness in Laska's exploration. A little marsh bird\n",
      "did not divert her attention for more than an instant. She made one\n",
      "circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly\n",
      "quivered with excitement and became motionless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, come, Stiva!\" shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat\n",
      "more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had\n",
      "been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud,\n",
      "began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance. He heard the\n",
      "steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses\n",
      "in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had\n",
      "trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse. He heard too, not\n",
      "far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could not explain to\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fetch it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog. Levin had lifted\n",
      "his gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of\n",
      "splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of\n",
      "Veslovsky's voice, shouting something with strange loudness. Levin saw\n",
      "he had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the\n",
      "horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got\n",
      "the horses stuck in the mud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Damn the fellow!\" Levin said to himself, as he went back to the\n",
      "carriage that had sunk in the mire. \"What did you drive in for?\" he said\n",
      "to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the horses out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses\n",
      "getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the\n",
      "horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion\n",
      "of harnessing. Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka's\n",
      "protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin worked in silence\n",
      "with the coachman at extricating the horses. But then, as he got warm at\n",
      "the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette\n",
      "by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it indeed, Levin blamed\n",
      "himself for having under the influence of yesterday's feelings been too\n",
      "cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth\n",
      "over his chilliness. When everything had been put right, and the\n",
      "carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch served.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Bon appetit--bonne conscience! Ce poulet va tomber jusqu'au fond de\n",
      "mes bottes_,\" Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the French\n",
      "saying as he finished his second chicken. \"Well, now our troubles are\n",
      "over, now everything's going to go well. Only, to atone for my sins, I'm\n",

      "You shall see how I'll get you along,\" he answered, not letting go the\n",
      "rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman drive. \"No, I must atone\n",
      "for my sins, and I'm very comfortable on the box.\" And he drove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the\n",
      "chestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he fell\n",

      "the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he gave of\n",
      "driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very\n",

      "Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too\n",
      "early, while it was still hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their\n",
      "expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of\n",
      "Vassenka and be free in his movements. Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had\n",
      "the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always\n",
      "present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a\n",
      "certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How shall we go? It's a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks,\"\n",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the\n",
      "reeds. \"Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen,\" said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the\n",
      "lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, \"do you see those\n",
      "reeds?\" He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown\n",
      "wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river. \"The marsh\n",
      "begins here, straight in front of us, do you see--where it is greener?\n",
      "From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding\n",
      "places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that\n",
      "alder, and right up to the mill. Over there, do you see, where the pools\n",
      "are? That's the best place. There I once shot seventeen snipe. We'll\n",
      "separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet\n",
      "over there at the mill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, which shall go to left and which to right?\" asked Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch. \"It's wider to the right; you two go that way and I'll\n",
      "take the left,\" he said with apparent carelessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Capital! we'll make the bigger bag! Yes, come along, come along!\"\n",
      "Vassenka exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about\n",
      "together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool. Levin knew\n",
      "Laska's method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected\n",
      "a whole covey of snipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!\" he said in a faint voice to his\n",
      "companion splashing in the water behind him. Levin could not help\n",
      "feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that\n",
      "casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I won't get in your way, don't trouble about me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty's words at\n",
      "parting: \"Mind you don't shoot one another.\" The dogs came nearer and\n",
      "nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent. The expectation\n",
      "of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own\n",
      "heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a\n",
      "snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bang! bang!\" sounded almost in his ear. Vassenka had fired at a flock\n",
      "of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment\n",
      "towards the sportsmen, far out of range. Before Levin had time to look\n",
      "round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some eight\n",
      "more rose one after another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its\n",
      "zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud. Oblonsky\n",
      "aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and\n",
      "together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could\n",
      "be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing\n",
      "showing white beneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed;\n",
      "he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another\n",
      "snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he missed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky,\n",
      "who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the\n",
      "water. Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes\n",
      "looked at Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now let us separate,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on\n",
      "his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog, he\n",
      "walked off in one direction. Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure\n",
      "he got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day. So it was\n",
      "that day. The snipe showed themselves in numbers. They kept flying up\n",
      "from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen's legs, and Levin\n",
      "might have retrieved his ill luck. But the more he shot, the more he\n",
      "felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily\n",
      "and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed\n",
      "by his ill success. Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain\n",
      "himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost\n",
      "without a hope of hitting. Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this. She\n",
      "began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it\n",
      "were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes. Shots followed shots in\n",
      "rapid succession. The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen,\n",
      "while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light\n",
      "little snipe. And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and\n",
      "one by both of them together. Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh\n",
      "came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch's shots, not frequent, but, as\n",
      "Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard \"Krak,\n",
      "Krak, _apporte_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This excited Levin still more. The snipe were floating continually in\n",
      "the air over the reeds. Their whirring wings close to the earth, and\n",
      "their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the\n",
      "snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again\n",
      "before the sportsmen. Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them\n",
      "hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky\n",
      "reached the place where the peasants' mowing-grass was divided into long\n",
      "strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the trampled\n",
      "grass, in another by a path mown through it. Half of these strips had\n",
      "already been mown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as\n",
      "the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and so\n",
      "he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hi, sportsmen!\" shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an\n",
      "unharnessed cart; \"come and have some lunch with us! Have a drop of\n",
      "wine!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin looked round.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come along, it's all right!\" shouted a good-humored-looking bearded\n",
      "peasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding\n",
      "up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Qu'est-ce qu'ils disent_?\" asked Veslovsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they've been dividing\n",
      "the meadow into lots. I should have some,\" said Levin, not without some\n",
      "guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go away\n",
      "to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do they offer it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, they're merry-making. Really, you should join them. You would be\n",
      "interested.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Allons, c'est curieux_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You go, you go, you'll find the way to the mill!\" cried Levin, and\n",
      "looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and\n",
      "stumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm's length, was\n",
      "making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You come too!\" the peasants shouted to Levin. \"Never fear! You taste\n",
      "our cake!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some\n",
      "bread. He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his\n",
      "staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated. But\n",
      "Laska was setting. And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he\n",
      "walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog. A snipe flew up at his\n",
      "feet; he fired and killed it. Laska still pointed.--\"Fetch it!\" Another\n",
      "bird flew up close to the dog. Levin fired. But it was an unlucky day\n",
      "for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for the one he had shot,\n",
      "he could not find that either. He wandered all about the reeds, but\n",
      "Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he sent her to find it,\n",
      "she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really. And in the absence of\n",
      "Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure, things went no\n",
      "better. There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made one miss after\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked through\n",
      "with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of water\n",
      "weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat ran in\n",
      "drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the bitter\n",
      "taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his ears were\n",
      "ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not touch the\n",
      "stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short, rapid\n",
      "throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs stumbled and\n",
      "staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he walked on and\n",
      "still he shot. At last, after a disgraceful miss, he flung his gun and\n",
      "his hat on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I must control myself,\" he said to himself. Picking up his gun and\n",
      "his hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp. When he got on to\n",
      "dry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it, then walked\n",
      "to the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his burning\n",
      "hot gun, and washed his face and hands. Feeling refreshed, he went back\n",
      "to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "He tried to be calm, but it was the same again. His finger pressed the\n",
      "cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird. It got worse and worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh\n",
      "towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",

      "Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog. Krak\n",
      "darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with\n",
      "the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed\n",
      "at Laska. Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder\n",
      "tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch. He came to meet him, red\n",
      "and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well? You have been popping away!\" he said, smiling good-humoredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How have you got on?\" queried Levin. But there was no need to ask, for\n",
      "he had already seen the full game bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, pretty fair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had fourteen birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A splendid marsh! I've no doubt Veslovsky got in your way. It's awkward\n",

      "When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant's hut where Levin\n",
      "always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there. He was sitting in the\n",
      "middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from which he\n",
      "was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant's wife, who\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've only just come. _Ils ont ete charmants_. Just fancy, they gave me\n",

      "In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their\n",
      "boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of\n",
      "marsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives and\n",
      "forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only\n",
      "known to sportsmen. Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn swept\n",

      "of former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that\n",
      "interested all of them. After Vassenka had several times over expressed\n",
      "his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant\n",
      "hay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because\n",
      "the shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that\n",
      "had treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their\n",
      "respective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting\n",
      "party at Malthus's, where he had stayed the previous summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by\n",
      "speculation in railway shares. Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse\n",
      "moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they were\n",
      "preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party\n",
      "had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at\n",
      "the marsh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't understand you,\" said Levin, sitting up in the hay; \"how is it\n",
      "such people don't disgust you? I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is\n",
      "all very pleasant, but don't you dislike just that very sumptuousness?\n",
      "All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get\n",
      "their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone. They\n",
      "don't care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains\n",
      "to buy off the contempt they have deserved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly true!\" chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky. \"Perfectly! Oblonsky, of\n",
      "course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say: 'Well, Oblonsky\n",
      "stays with them.'...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit of it.\" Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he\n",
      "spoke. \"I simply don't consider him more dishonest than any other\n",
      "wealthy merchant or nobleman. They've all made their money alike--by\n",
      "their work and their intelligence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, by what work? Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and\n",
      "speculate with them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course it's work. Work in this sense, that if it were not for him\n",
      "and others like him, there would have been no railways.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that's not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned\n",
      "profession.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Granted, but it's work in the sense that his activity produces a\n",
      "result--the railways. But of course you think the railways useless.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, that's another question; I am prepared to admit that they're\n",
      "useful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended\n",
      "is dishonest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who is to define what is proportionate?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,\" said Levin, conscious\n",
      "that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.\n",
      "\"Such as banking, for instance,\" he went on. \"It's an evil--the amassing\n",
      "of huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit\n",
      "monopolies, it's only the form that's changed. _Le roi est mort, vive le\n",
      "roi_. No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways\n",
      "came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that may all be very true and clever.... Lie down, Krak!\" Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching and turning over all\n",
      "the hay. He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position,\n",
      "and so talked serenely and without haste. \"But you have not drawn the\n",
      "line between honest and dishonest work. That I receive a bigger salary\n",
      "than my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I\n",
      "do--that's dishonest, I suppose?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let's say,\n",
      "for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here, however\n",
      "hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just as\n",
      "dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus getting\n",
      "more than a station-master. No, quite the contrary; I see that society\n",
      "takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which is\n",
      "utterly baseless, and I fancy there's envy at the bottom of it....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, that's unfair,\" said Veslovsky; \"how could envy come in? There is\n",
      "something not nice about that sort of business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say,\" Levin went on, \"that it's unjust for me to receive five\n",
      "thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that's true. It is unfair, and I\n",
      "feel it, but...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It really is. Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting,\n",
      "doing nothing, while they are forever at work?\" said Vassenka Veslovsky,\n",
      "obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question, and\n",
      "consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you feel it, but you don't give him your property,\" said Stepan\n",

      "\n",
      "There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the\n",
      "two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind\n",
      "of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life\n",
      "best, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it\n",
      "began to take a personal note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is it\n",
      "you don't act accordingly?...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to\n",
      "increase the difference of position existing between him and me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, excuse me, that's a paradox.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there's something of a sophistry about that,\" Veslovsky agreed.\n",
      "\"Ah! our host; so you're not asleep yet?\" he said to the peasant who\n",
      "came into the barn, opening the creaking door. \"How is it you're not\n",
      "asleep?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, how's one to sleep! I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I\n",
      "heard them chattering. I want to get a hook from here. She won't bite?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"We are going out for the night with the beasts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, what a night!\" said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge of the hut\n",
      "and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of\n",
      "the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors. \"But listen,\n",
      "there are women's voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too. Who's\n",
      "that singing, my friend?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the maids from hard by here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's go, let's have a walk! We shan't go to sleep, you know. Oblonsky,\n",
      "come along!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If one could only do both, lie here and go,\" answered Oblonsky,\n",
      "stretching. \"It's capital lying here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I shall go by myself,\" said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and\n",
      "putting on his shoes and stockings. \"Good-bye, gentlemen. If it's fun,\n",
      "I'll fetch you. You've treated me to some good sport, and I won't forget\n",
      "you.\"\n",

      "\"He really is a capital fellow, isn't he?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n",
      "when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, capital,\" answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their\n",
      "conversation just before. It seemed to him that he had clearly expressed\n",
      "his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity, and yet both of\n",
      "them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one voice that he\n",
      "was comforting himself with sophistries. This disconcerted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's just this, my dear boy. One must do one of two things: either\n",
      "admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for\n",
      "one's rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust\n",
      "privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be\n",
      "satisfied--at least I could not. The great thing for me is to feel that\n",
      "I'm not to blame.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you say, why not go after all?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n",
      "evidently weary of the strain of thought. \"We shan't go to sleep, you\n",
      "know. Come, let's go!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin did not answer. What they had said in the conversation, that he\n",
      "acted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts. \"Can it be\n",
      "that it's only possible to be just negatively?\" he was asking himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,\" said Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, getting up. \"There's not a chance of sleeping. Vassenka\n",
      "has been getting up some fun there. Do you hear the laughing and his\n",
      "voice? Hadn't we better go? Come along!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm not coming,\" answered Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Surely that's not a matter of principle too,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n",
      "smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not a matter of principle, but why should I go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,\" said Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife? I\n",
      "heard how it's a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not\n",
      "you're to be away for a couple of days' shooting. That's all very well\n",
      "as an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won't answer. A man\n",
      "must be independent; he has his masculine interests. A man has to be\n",
      "manly,\" said Oblonsky, opening the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In what way? To go running after servant girls?\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not, if it amuses him? _Ca ne tire pas a consequence_. It won't do\n",
      "my wife any harm, and it'll amuse me. The great thing is to respect the\n",
      "sanctity of the home. There should be nothing in the home. But don't tie\n",
      "your own hands.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps so,\" said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side. \"Tomorrow,\n",
      "early, I want to go shooting, and I won't wake anyone, and shall set off\n",
      "at daybreak.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Messieurs, venez vite!_\" they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming\n",
      "back. \"_Charmante!_ I've made such a discovery. _Charmante!_ a perfect\n",
      "Gretchen, and I've already made friends with her. Really, exceedingly\n",
      "pretty,\" he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had been made\n",
      "pretty entirely on his account, and he was expressing his satisfaction\n",
      "with the entertainment that had been provided for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers,\n",
      "and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices were\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long while Levin could not get to sleep. He heard the horses\n",
      "munching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready\n",
      "for the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then\n",
      "he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn,\n",
      "with his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host. He heard the boy\n",
      "in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the\n",
      "dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking what the\n",
      "dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky, sleepy\n",
      "voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh,\n",
      "and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the boy's questions,\n",
      "he said, \"Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you'll catch it,\" and soon\n",
      "after he began snoring himself, and everything was still. He could only\n",
      "hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is it really only negative?\" he repeated to himself. \"Well, what of it?\n",
      "It's not my fault.\" And he began thinking about the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tomorrow I'll go out early, and I'll make a point of keeping cool.\n",
      "There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. When I come back\n",
      "there'll be the note from Kitty. Yes, Stiva may be right, I'm not manly\n",
      "with her, I'm tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can't be helped!\n",
      "Negative again....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch. For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up,\n",
      "and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were\n",
      "standing talking. Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the\n",
      "freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and\n",
      "Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably\n",
      "said to him by a peasant: \"Ah, you do your best to get round her!\"\n",

      "Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.\n",
      "Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out,\n",
      "was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response. Oblonsky, half\n",
      "asleep, declined to get up so early. Even Laska, who was asleep, curled\n",
      "up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and\n",
      "straightened her hind legs one after the other. Getting on his boots and\n",
      "stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door of\n",
      "the barn, Levin went out into the road. The coachmen were sleeping in\n",
      "their carriages, the horses were dozing. Only one was lazily eating\n",
      "oats, dipping its nose into the manger. It was still gray out-of-doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why are you up so early, my dear?\" the old woman, their hostess, said,\n",
      "coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Going shooting, granny. Do I go this way to the marsh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp\n",
      "patches; there's a little footpath.\" Stepping carefully with her\n",
      "sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the\n",
      "fence for him by the threshing floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Straight on and you'll come to the marsh. Our lads drove the cattle\n",
      "there yesterday evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path. Levin followed her with\n",
      "a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky. He hoped the sun\n",
      "would not be up before he reached the marsh. But the sun did not delay.\n",
      "The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone only like\n",
      "a crescent of quicksilver. The pink flush of dawn, which one could not\n",
      "help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all. What\n",
      "were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside could now\n",
      "be distinctly seen. They were sheaves of rye. The dew, not visible till\n",
      "the sun was up, wetted Levin's legs and his blouse above his belt in the\n",
      "high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the pollen had already\n",
      "fallen out. In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds\n",
      "were audible. A bee flew by Levin's ear with the whizzing sound of a\n",
      "bullet. He looked carefully, and saw a second and a third. They were all\n",
      "flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeared over the\n",
      "hemp patch in the direction of the marsh. The path led straight to the\n",
      "marsh. The marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it,\n",
      "thicker in one place and thinner in another, so that the reeds and\n",
      "willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist. At the edge of the marsh\n",
      "and the road, peasant boys and men, who had been herding for the night,\n",
      "were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats. Not far\n",
      "from them were three hobbled horses. One of them clanked a chain. Laska\n",
      "walked beside her master, pressing a little forward and looking round.\n",
      "Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds, Levin\n",
      "examined his pistols and let his dog off. One of the horses, a sleek,\n",
      "dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started away, switched its\n",
      "tail and snorted. The other horses too were frightened, and splashing\n",
      "through the water with their hobbled legs, and drawing their hoofs out\n",
      "of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they bounded out of the marsh.\n",
      "Laska stopped, looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at\n",
      "Levin. Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a sign that she might begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh plants,\n",
      "and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska detected at\n",
      "once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of that\n",
      "strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other. Here\n",
      "and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong,\n",
      "but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger\n",
      "or fainter. To find the direction, she had to go farther away from the\n",
      "wind. Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a stiff\n",
      "gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right, away\n",
      "from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing\n",
      "the wind. Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at once\n",
      "that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her, and\n",
      "not one, but many. Laska slackened her speed. They were here, but where\n",
      "precisely she could not yet determine. To find the very spot, she began\n",
      "to make a circle, when suddenly her master's voice drew her off. \"Laska!\n",
      "here?\" he asked, pointing her to a different direction. She stopped,\n",
      "asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun. But he\n",
      "repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing to a spot covered with\n",
      "water, where there could not be anything. She obeyed him, pretending she\n",
      "was looking, so as to please him, went round it, and went back to her\n",
      "former position, and was at once aware of the scent again. Now when he\n",
      "was not hindering her, she knew what to do, and without looking at what\n",
      "was under her feet, and to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into\n",
      "the water, but righting herself with her strong, supple legs, she began\n",
      "making the circle which was to make all clear to her. The scent of them\n",
      "reached her, stronger and stronger, and more and more defined, and all\n",
      "at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here,\n",
      "behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in front of her; she stopped, and\n",
      "her whole body was still and rigid. On her short legs she could see\n",
      "nothing in front of her, but by the scent she knew it was sitting not\n",
      "more than five paces off. She stood still, feeling more and more\n",
      "conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation. Her tail was stretched\n",
      "straight and tense, and only wagging at the extreme end. Her mouth was\n",
      "slightly open, her ears raised. One ear had been turned wrong side out\n",
      "as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but warily, and still more\n",
      "warily looked round, but more with her eyes than her head, to her\n",
      "master. He was coming along with the face she knew so well, though the\n",
      "eyes were always terrible to her. He stumbled over the stump as he came,\n",
      "and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly. She thought he came\n",
      "slowly, but he was running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noticing Laska's special attitude as she crouched on the ground, as it\n",
      "were, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth\n",
      "slightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an inward\n",
      "prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to her.\n",
      "Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond her,\n",
      "and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose. In a space\n",
      "between two little thickets, at a couple of yards' distance, he could\n",
      "see a grouse. Turning its head, it was listening. Then lightly preening\n",
      "and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag\n",
      "of its tail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fetch it, fetch it!\" shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I can't go,\" thought Laska. \"Where am I to go? From here I feel\n",
      "them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or\n",
      "who they are.\" But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited\n",
      "whisper said, \"Fetch it, Laska.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that's what he wishes, I'll do it, but I can't answer for\n",
      "myself now,\" she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would\n",
      "carry her between the thick bushes. She scented nothing now; she could\n",
      "only see and hear, without understanding anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and\n",
      "the peculiar round sound of its wings. And immediately after the shot it\n",
      "splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire. Another bird did\n",
      "not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog. When Levin turned\n",
      "towards it, it was already some way off. But his shot caught it. Flying\n",
      "twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and whirling round\n",
      "like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, this is going to be some good!\" thought Levin, packing the warm\n",
      "and fat grouse into his game bag. \"Eh, Laska, will it be good?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen,\n",
      "though unseen behind the storm-clouds. The moon had lost all of its\n",
      "luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky. Not a single star could\n",
      "be seen. The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold. The\n",
      "stagnant pools were all like amber. The blue of the grass had changed to\n",
      "yellow-green. The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and\n",
      "upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows. A hawk\n",
      "woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and\n",
      "looking discontentedly at the marsh. Crows were flying about the field,\n",
      "and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got\n",
      "up from under his long coat and was combing his hair. The smoke from the\n",
      "gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the boys ran up to Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!\" he shouted to him, and he\n",
      "walked a little way off behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his\n",
      "approval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.\n",

      "miles, returned to his night's lodging with nineteen head of fine game\n",
      "and one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go into the\n",

      "hungry and have breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,\" said Levin,\n",

      "\n",
      "These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife,\n",

      "sorts. The coachman said he was \"Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin\n",

      "\n",
      "The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his\n",
      "good humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find that\n",
      "of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one\n",
      "would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left. On his\n",
      "way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct a vision\n",
      "of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste\n",
      "them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told Philip to\n",
      "give him some. It appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any\n",
      "chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, this fellow's appetite!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and\n",

      "The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the same\n",

      "afforded her by the young man's very obvious admiration. She wanted to\n",
      "stop it, but she did not know what to do. Whatever she did she knew\n",
      "would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put on\n",

      "begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wanted....\" He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and everything\n",

      "Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had\n",
      "proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft\n",

      "flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing room\n",
      "furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak. Then questions of the\n",
      "more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children in\n",
      "the world. \"The girls are all right,\" she thought; \"but the boys?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very well that I'm teaching Grisha, but of course that's only\n",

      "there's no counting on. And with the help of good-natured friends I can\n",
      "bring them up; but if there's another baby coming?...\" And the thought\n",

      "\n",

      "conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn. On being\n",
      "asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had\n",
      "answered cheerfully:\n",

      "\"I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.\"\n",

      "whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life,\n",

      "most of all--hideousness. Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even Kitty\n",
      "has lost her looks; and I when I'm with child become hideous, I know it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from\n",
      "sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child. \"Then the\n",
      "children's illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them\n",
      "up; evil propensities\" (she thought of little Masha's crime among the\n",
      "raspberries), \"education, Latin--it's all so incomprehensible and\n",
      "difficult. And on the top of it all, the death of these children.\" And\n",
      "there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always\n",
      "tore her mother's heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had\n",
      "died of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the\n",
      "little pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at\n",
      "the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the\n",
      "open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it\n",
      "was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And all this, what's it for? What is to come of it all? That I'm\n",

      "nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and\n",
      "worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing\n",
      "up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless. Even now, if it weren't for\n",
      "spending the summer at the Levins', I don't know how we should be\n",

      "don't feel it; but it can't go on. They'll have children, they won't be\n",
      "able to keep us; it's a drag on them as it is. How is papa, who has\n",
      "hardly anything left for himself, to help us? So that I can't even bring\n",
      "the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other\n",
      "people, at the cost of humiliation. Why, even if we suppose the greatest\n",
      "good luck, that the children don't die, and I bring them up somehow. At\n",
      "the very best they'll simply be decent people. That's all I can hope\n",
      "for. And to gain simply that--what agonies, what toil!... One's whole\n",
      "life ruined!\" Again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said,\n",
      "and again she was revolted at the thought; but she could not help\n",
      "admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words.\n",
      "\n",

      "the village street and onto a bridge. On the bridge was a crowd of\n",
      "peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders,\n",
      "gaily and noisily chattering. They stood still on the bridge, staring\n",
      "inquisitively at the carriage. All the faces turned to Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of\n",
      "their enjoyment of life. \"They're all living, they're all enjoying\n",
      "life,\" Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant\n",
      "women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the\n",
      "soft springs of the old carriage, \"while I, let out, as it were from\n",
      "prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking\n",
      "about me now for an instant. They all live; those peasant women and my\n",
      "sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see--all, but\n",
      "not I.\n",

      "has put that in our hearts. Very likely I should have done the same.\n",
      "Even to this day I don't feel sure I did right in listening to her at\n",
      "that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. I ought then to have\n",
      "cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh. I might have loved and\n",
      "have been loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I don't\n",
      "respect him. He's necessary to me,\" she thought about her husband, \"and\n",

      "been admired, I had beauty left me still,\" Darya Alexandrovna pursued\n",
      "her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking\n",
      "glass. She had a traveling looking glass in her handbag, and she wanted\n",
      "to take it out; but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying\n",
      "counting house clerk, she felt that she would be ashamed if either of\n",
      "them were to look round, and she did not take out the glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not\n",
      "too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always\n",
      "particularly attentive to her, of Stiva's good-hearted friend,\n",
      "Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina,\n",
      "and was in love with her. And there was someone else, a quite young man,\n",
      "who--her husband had told her it as a joke--thought her more beautiful\n",
      "than either of her sisters. And the most passionate and impossible\n",
      "romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna's imagination. \"Anna did quite\n",
      "right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it. She is happy,\n",
      "she makes another person happy, and she's not broken down as I am, but\n",
      "most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to every\n",
      "impression,\" thought Darya Alexandrovna,--and a sly smile curved her\n",
      "lips, for, as she pondered on Anna's love affair, Darya Alexandrovna\n",
      "constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for\n",
      "herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in\n",
      "love with her. She, like Anna, confessed the whole affair to her\n",

      "But I'm glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I shouldn't like\n",

      "was not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.\n",
      "Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by\n",

      "seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing\n",
      "himself to the ladies, he went to meet him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still\n",
      "with the architect and began talking rather warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The front is still too low,\" he said to Anna, who had asked what was\n",

      "expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture. \"This new\n",
      "building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital. It was an\n",
      "afterthought, and was begun without a plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the ladies,\n",
      "and led them inside the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were\n",
      "painting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were\n",
      "finished. Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they\n",
      "walked into the first large room. The walls were stuccoed to look like\n",
      "marble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet\n",
      "floor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a block\n",
      "of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their hair,\n",

      "From the reception room they went into the corridor. Here Vronsky showed\n",

      "them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs. Then he showed\n",
      "them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then\n",
      "the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make\n",
      "no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many\n",
      "other things. Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical\n",
      "improvements, appreciated everything fully. Dolly simply wondered at all\n",

      "happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna's mind. \"But can it last?\n",
      "Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but the\n",
      "die is cast,\" he said, passing from Russian to French, \"and we are bound\n",
      "together for life. We are united by all the ties of love that we hold\n",
      "most sacred. We have a child, we may have other children. But the law\n",
      "and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of\n",
      "complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see. And\n",
      "that one can well understand. But I can't help seeing them. My daughter\n",
      "is by law not my daughter, but Karenin's. I cannot bear this falsity!\"\n",
      "he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked with gloomy\n",
      "inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "She made no answer, but simply gazed at him. He went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin; he\n",
      "will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however happy we\n",
      "may be in our home life and however many children we may have, there\n",
      "will be no real tie between us. They will be Karenins. You can\n",
      "understand the bitterness and horror of this position! I have tried to\n",
      "speak of this to Anna. It irritates her. She does not understand, and to\n",
      "her I cannot speak plainly of all this. Now look at another side. I am\n",
      "happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation. I have found\n",
      "occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than\n",
      "the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army. And most\n",
      "certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs. I am\n",
      "working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented, and\n",
      "we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work here. _Ce n'est\n",
      "pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew\n",
      "confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but she felt\n",
      "that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of which he\n",
      "could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of everything,\n",
      "and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same\n",
      "category of matters near his heart, as the question of his relations\n",
      "with Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I will go on,\" he said, collecting himself. \"The great thing is\n",
      "that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will not\n",
      "die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me,--and this I have\n",
      "not. Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children, the\n",
      "children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to\n",
      "someone who hates them and cares nothing about them! It is awful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused, evidently much moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, I see that. But what can Anna do?\" queried Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,\" he said, calming\n",
      "himself with an effort. \"Anna can, it depends on her.... Even to\n",
      "petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential. And that\n",
      "depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a divorce--at that time your\n",
      "husband had arranged it completely. And now, I know, he would not refuse\n",
      "it. It is only a matter of writing to him. He said plainly at that time\n",
      "that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse. Of course,\" he\n",
      "said gloomily, \"it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of which only\n",
      "such heartless men are capable. He knows what agony any recollection of\n",
      "him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a letter from her. I\n",
      "can understand that it is agony to her. But the matter is of such\n",
      "importance, that one must _passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de\n",
      "sentiment. Il y va du bonheur et de l'existence d'Anne et de ses\n",
      "enfants._ I won't speak of myself, though it's hard for me, very hard,\"\n",
      "he said, with an expression as though he were threatening someone for\n",
      "its being hard for him. \"And so it is, princess, that I am shamelessly\n",
      "clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help me to persuade her to\n",
      "write to him and ask for a divorce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course,\" Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly\n",
      "recalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch. \"Yes, of\n",
      "course,\" she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Use your influence with her, make her write. I don't like--I'm almost\n",
      "unable to speak about this to her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, I will talk to her. But how is it she does not think of it\n",
      "herself?\" said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at\n",
      "that point recalled Anna's strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.\n",
      "And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper\n",
      "questions of life were touched upon. \"Just as though she half-shut her\n",
      "eyes to her own life, so as not to see everything,\" thought Dolly. \"Yes,\n",
      "indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her,\" Dolly said in\n",
      "reply to his look of gratitude.\n",

      "When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her\n",
      "eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with Vronsky,\n",
      "but she made no inquiry in words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it's dinner time,\" she said. \"We've not seen each other at\n",
      "all yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and dress. I\n",
      "expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly went to her room and she felt amused. To change her dress was\n",
      "impossible, for she had already put on her best dress. But in order to\n",
      "signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to\n",
      "brush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is all I can do,\" she said with a smile to Anna, who came in to\n",
      "her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, we are too formal here,\" she said, as it were apologizing for her\n",
      "magnificence. \"Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at\n",
      "anything. He has completely lost his heart to you,\" she added. \"You're\n",
      "not tired?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no time for talking about anything before dinner. Going into\n",
      "the drawing room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the\n",
      "gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats. The architect wore a\n",
      "swallow-tail coat. Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his\n",
      "guest. The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a\n",
      "starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies\n",
      "got up. Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself\n",
      "offered his arm to Dolly. Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering\n",
      "his arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and\n",
      "the doctor walked in alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner, the dining room, the service, the waiting at table, the\n",
      "wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of\n",
      "modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous\n",
      "and modern. Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to\n",
      "her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household--although\n",
      "she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as\n",
      "it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living--she\n",
      "could not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom\n",
      "it was all done. Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviazhsky,\n",
      "and many other people she knew, would never have considered this\n",
      "question, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host\n",
      "tries to make his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered in\n",
      "his house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of\n",
      "itself. Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the\n",
      "children's breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where\n",
      "so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained, someone\n",
      "must give earnest attention to its organization. And from the glance\n",
      "with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way he nodded\n",
      "to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice between cold\n",
      "soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and maintained by\n",
      "the care of the master of the house himself. It was evident that it all\n",
      "rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky. She, Sviazhsky, the\n",
      "princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying\n",
      "what had been arranged for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation. The\n",
      "conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small\n",
      "table with persons present, like the steward and the architect,\n",
      "belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed\n",
      "by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a\n",
      "large share in the general conversation. But this difficult conversation\n",
      "Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she did so\n",
      "with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed. The conversation\n",
      "began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together\n",
      "in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in\n",
      "Petersburg at the Yacht Club. But Anna, seizing the first pause, at once\n",
      "turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,\" she said, meaning Sviazhsky, \"at the\n",
      "progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am\n",
      "there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's first-rate working with his excellency,\" said the architect with a\n",
      "smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his own\n",
      "dignity). \"It's a very different matter to have to do with the district\n",
      "authorities. Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here I\n",
      "call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The American way of doing business,\" said Sviazhsky, with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, there they build in a rational fashion...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United\n",
      "States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to\n",
      "draw the steward into talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have you ever seen a reaping machine?\" she said, addressing Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna. \"We had just ridden over to look at one when we met. It's\n",
      "the first time I ever saw one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do they work?\" asked Dolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly like little scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors.\n",
      "Like this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with\n",
      "rings, and began showing how the machine worked. It was clear that she\n",
      "saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that her\n",
      "talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"More like little penknives,\" Veslovsky said playfully, never taking his\n",
      "eyes off her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer. \"Isn't it true,\n",
      "Karl Fedoritch, that it's just like little scissors?\" she said to the\n",
      "steward.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Oh, ja,_\" answered the German. _\"Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,\"_ and\n",
      "he began to explain the construction of the machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a pity it doesn't bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition,\n",
      "which binds with a wire,\" said Sviazhsky. \"They would be more profitable\n",
      "in use.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "_\"Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.\"_\n",
      "And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky. _\"Das\n",
      "laesst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.\"_ The German was just feeling in the\n",
      "pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in, but\n",
      "recollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky's chilly\n",
      "glance, he checked himself. _\"Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,\"_ he\n",
      "concluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "_\"Wuenscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,\"_ said Vassenka\n",
      "Veslovsky, mimicking the German. _\"J'adore l'allemand,\"_ he addressed\n",
      "Anna again with the same smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "_\"Cessez,\"_ she said with playful severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,\" she said to\n",
      "the doctor, a sickly-looking man; \"have you been there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went there, but I had taken flight,\" the doctor answered with gloomy\n",
      "jocoseness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you've taken a good constitutional?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it's not typhus?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Typhus it is not, but it's taking a bad turn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a pity!\" said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to\n",
      "her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your\n",
      "description, Anna Arkadyevna,\" Sviazhsky said jestingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, why so?\" said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew\n",
      "there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that\n",
      "had been noticed by Sviazhsky. This new trait of girlish coquettishness\n",
      "made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Anna Arkadyevna's knowledge of architecture is marvelous,\" said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and\n",
      "damp-courses,\" said Veslovsky. \"Have I got it right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of\n",
      "it,\" said Anna. \"But, I dare say, you don't even know what houses are\n",
      "made of?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that\n",
      "existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin. He obviously\n",
      "attached no significance to Veslovsky's chattering; on the contrary, he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Bravo! And what is cement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,\" said Veslovsky, raising a\n",
      "general laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect,\n",
      "and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a\n",
      "conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on\n",
      "another, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick. Once Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she\n",
      "positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything\n",
      "extreme or unpleasant. Sviazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his\n",
      "strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on\n",
      "Russian agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,\" Vronsky said,\n",
      "smiling, \"but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns; or\n",
      "if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer fashion,\n",
      "some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad. What sort of views\n",
      "can anyone have on such a subject?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Turkish views, in general,\" Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't defend his opinions,\" Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up; \"but\n",
      "I can say that he's a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he\n",
      "would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of doing\n",
      "so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like him extremely, and we are great friends,\" Sviazhsky said,\n",
      "smiling good-naturedly. \"_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toque;_ he\n",
      "maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards\n",
      "are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's our Russian apathy,\" said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced\n",
      "decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; \"we've no sense of the\n",
      "duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize\n",
      "these duties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,\" said Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky's tone of superiority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For my part,\" pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or\n",
      "other keenly affected by this conversation, \"such as I am, I am, on the\n",
      "contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to\n",
      "Nikolay Ivanitch\" (he indicated Sviazhsky), \"in electing me a justice of\n",
      "the peace. I consider that for me the duty of being present at the\n",
      "session, of judging some peasants' quarrel about a horse, is as\n",
      "important as anything I can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if\n",
      "they elect me for the district council. It's only in that way I can pay\n",
      "for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don't\n",
      "understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the\n",
      "state.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he\n",
      "was of being right at his own table. She thought how Levin, who believed\n",
      "the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table. But\n",
      "she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?\" said\n",
      "Sviazhsky. \"But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I rather agree with your beau-frere,\" said Anna, \"though not quite on\n",
      "the same ground as he,\" she added with a smile. \"I'm afraid that we have\n",
      "too many of these public duties in these latter days. Just as in old\n",
      "days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in\n",
      "a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone's doing some sort\n",
      "of public duty. Alexey has been here now six months, and he's a member,\n",
      "I do believe, of five or six different public bodies. _Du train que cela\n",
      "va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it. And I'm afraid that with such\n",
      "a multiplicity of these bodies, they'll end in being a mere form. How\n",
      "many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?\" she turned to\n",
      "Sviazhsky--\"over twenty, I fancy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone. Darya\n",
      "Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it\n",
      "instantly. She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky's face had\n",
      "immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression. Noticing this, and\n",
      "that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by\n",
      "talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had\n",
      "without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the\n",
      "country, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was\n",
      "connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good;\n",
      "but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners\n",
      "and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all\n",
      "had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary\n",
      "day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression\n",
      "on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn\n",
      "tennis. The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides\n",

      "struck her: could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been better\n",
      "for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed? And this seemed to her\n",

      "heard that the committee had not verified the accounts, considering such\n",
      "a verification an insult to the marshal of the province. One of the\n",
      "members of the committee incautiously admitted this. Then a small\n",

      "account of his expenditures of the public moneys, and that the misplaced\n",
      "delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral\n",
      "satisfaction. Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their\n",
      "admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically\n",
      "admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not,\n",
      "and he developed this dilemma in detail. Sergey Ivanovitch was answered\n",
      "by the spokesman of the opposite party. Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then\n",
      "the malignant gentleman again. The discussion lasted a long time and\n",
      "ended in nothing. Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this\n",

      "glad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was,\n",
      "and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan\n",

      "should be asked to stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "_\"O sancta simplicitas!\"_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and\n",
      "clearly he explained it to Levin. If, as at previous elections, all the\n",
      "districts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be\n",
      "elected without a ballot. That must not be. Now eight districts had\n",
      "agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline\n",
      "to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their\n",
      "party, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning. But if\n",
      "only one district, Sviazhsky's, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov\n",
      "would let himself be balloted for. They were even, some of them, going\n",
      "to vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that\n",
      "the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the\n",
      "other side was put up, they too might give him some votes. Levin\n",
      "understood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more\n",
      "questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and\n",
      "they moved towards the big room.\n",

      "charge against him?\" \"Why, at this rate, they won't admit anyone. It's a\n",

      "into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere and\n",
      "afraid of missing something. Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he drew\n",

      "prevented him from hearing distinctly. He could only hear the soft voice\n",
      "of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant\n",
      "gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky. They were disputing, as far\n",
      "as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and\n",

      "The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the\n",

      "shouted loudly: \"A ballot! Put it to the vote! No need for more\n",
      "talking!\" Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall\n",
      "nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more\n",
      "and more loudly. But it was impossible to make out what he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but\n",

      "Votes, please! Beastly!...\" shouted furious and violent voices on all\n",
      "sides. Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their\n",

      "least understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion\n",
      "with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov\n",
      "should be put to the vote. He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to\n",

      "all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an\n",
      "unpleasant and vicious state of excitement. To escape from this painful\n",
      "feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except\n",
      "the waiters at the refreshment bar. Seeing the waiters busy over washing\n",
      "up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine glasses,\n",
      "seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of\n",
      "relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air. He\n",
      "began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters. He\n",
      "particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his\n",
      "scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching\n",
      "them how to fold up napkins properly. Levin was just about to enter into\n",
      "conversation with the old waiter, when the secretary of the court of\n",

      "Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his\n",
      "brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing\n",
      "with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and\n",
      "sniffing at it. Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the\n",
      "ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped. Levin advanced, but\n",
      "utterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned to\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, \"Where am I to put it?\" He asked\n",
      "this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so that\n",
      "he had hoped his question would not be overheard. But the persons\n",
      "speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard. Sergey\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That is a matter for each man's own decision,\" he said severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several people smiled. Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under\n",
      "the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.\n",
      "Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left\n",
      "hand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more\n",
      "overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A hundred and twenty-six for admission! Ninety-eight against!\" sang out\n",
      "the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_. Then\n",
      "there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box. The\n",
      "nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had conquered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the old party did not consider themselves conquered. Levin heard\n",
      "that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of\n",
      "noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something. Levin\n",
      "went nearer. In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the\n",
      "province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he\n",
      "did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the\n",
      "nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service. Several times\n",
      "he repeated the words: \"I have served to the best of my powers with\n",
      "truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,\" and suddenly\n",
      "he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the\n",
      "room. Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done\n",
      "him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of the position\n",
      "he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies, his emotion\n",
      "infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin felt a\n",
      "tenderness for Snetkov.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Beg pardon, excuse me, please,\" he said as to a stranger, but\n",
      "recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly. It seemed to Levin that he would\n",
      "have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion. His face\n",
      "and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers\n",
      "striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some\n",
      "hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case. This expression in the\n",
      "marshal's face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day\n",
      "before, he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen\n",
      "him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man. The big house\n",
      "with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but\n",
      "respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their\n",
      "master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish\n",
      "shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter's daughter; the young\n",
      "son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting\n",
      "his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and\n",
      "gestures of the old man--all this had the day before roused an\n",
      "instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin. This old man was a\n",
      "touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say\n",
      "something pleasant to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you're sure to be our marshal again,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not likely,\" said the marshal, looking round with a scared\n",
      "expression. \"I'm worn out, I'm old. If there are men younger and more\n",
      "deserving than I, let them serve.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the marshal disappeared through a side door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most solemn moment was at hand. They were to proceed immediately to\n",
      "the election. The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black\n",
      "on their fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov's\n",

      "fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the\n",
      "elections by the wiles of the other party. Two noble gentlemen, who had\n",
      "a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of\n",
      "Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.\n",
      "\n",
      "On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, he's first-rate. If only they don't give him any more here.... I've\n",

      "caring to greet him. He went to the window and sat down, scanning the\n",
      "groups, and listening to what was being said around him. He felt\n",
      "depressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager,\n",
      "anxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little man\n",
      "with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had no\n",

      "had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and new boots\n",
      "obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically\n",

      "sharply turned his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it's a dirty business, there's no denying,\" a small gentleman\n",
      "assented in a high voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general,\n",
      "hurriedly came near Levin. These persons were unmistakably seeking a\n",
      "place where they could talk without being overheard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How dare he say I had his breeches stolen! Pawned them for drink, I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can\n",
      "never save a profit,\" he heard a pleasant voice say. The speaker was a\n",
      "country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of\n",
      "an old general staff-officer. It was the very landowner Levin had met at\n",
      "Sviazhsky's. He knew him at once. The landowner too stared at Levin, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,\" the landowner answered with\n",
      "a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and conviction that\n",
      "so it must be. \"And how do you come to be in our province?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"Come to take part in our _coup d'etat?_\" he said, confidently\n",
      "pronouncing the French words with a bad accent. \"All Russia's\n",
      "here--gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, what is there to understand? There's no meaning in it at all. It's\n",
      "a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of\n",
      "inertia. Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it's an assembly of\n",
      "justices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but\n",
      "not of noblemen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why do you come?\" asked Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From habit, nothing else. Then, too, one must keep up connections. It's\n",
      "a moral obligation of a sort. And then, to tell the truth, there's one's\n",
      "own interests. My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent member;\n",
      "they're not rich people, and he must be brought forward. These\n",
      "gentlemen, now, what do they come for?\" he said, pointing to the\n",
      "malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the new generation of nobility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"New it may be, but nobility it isn't. They're proprietors of a sort,\n",
      "but we're the landowners. As noblemen, they're cutting their own\n",
      "throats.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you say it's an institution that's served its time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more\n",
      "respectfully. Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but\n",
      "we're the growth of a thousand years. If we're laying out a garden,\n",
      "planning one before the house, you know, and there you've a tree that's\n",
      "stood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and\n",
      "yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds,\n",
      "but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree. You won't\n",
      "grow him again in a year,\" he said cautiously, and he immediately\n",
      "changed the conversation. \"Well, and how is your land doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, not very well. I make five per cent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but you don't reckon your own work. Aren't you worth something\n",
      "too? I'll tell you my own case. Before I took to seeing after the land,\n",
      "I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service. Now I do more\n",
      "work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent. on the\n",
      "land, and thank God for that. But one's work is thrown in for nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It's habit, and one knows\n",
      "it's how it should be. And what's more,\" the landowner went on, leaning\n",
      "his elbows on the window and chatting on, \"my son, I must tell you, has\n",
      "no taste for it. There's no doubt he'll be a scientific man. So there'll\n",
      "be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year I've\n",
      "planted an orchard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" said Levin, \"that's perfectly true. I always feel there's no\n",
      "real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....\n",
      "It's a sort of duty one feels to the land.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I tell you what,\" the landowner pursued; \"a neighbor of mine, a\n",
      "merchant, was at my place. We walked about the fields and the garden.\n",
      "'No,' said he, 'Stepan Vassilievitch, everything's well looked after,\n",
      "but your garden's neglected.' But, as a fact, it's well kept up. 'To my\n",
      "thinking, I'd cut down that lime-tree. Here you've thousands of limes,\n",
      "and each would make two good bundles of bark. And nowadays that bark's\n",
      "worth something. I'd cut down the lot.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And with what he made he'd increase his stock, or buy some land for a\n",
      "trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,\" Levin added, smiling.\n",
      "He had evidently more than once come across those commercial\n",
      "calculations. \"And he'd make his fortune. But you and I must thank God\n",
      "if we keep what we've got and leave it to our children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're married, I've heard?\" said the landowner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Levin answered, with proud satisfaction. \"Yes, it's rather\n",
      "strange,\" he went on. \"So we live without making anything, as though we\n",
      "were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or\n",
      "Count Vronsky, that's settled here lately, who try to carry on their\n",
      "husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing\n",
      "but making away with capital on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But why is it we don't do like the merchants? Why don't we cut down our\n",
      "parks for timber?\" said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, as you said, to keep the fire in. Besides that's not work for a\n",
      "nobleman. And our work as noblemen isn't done here at the elections, but\n",
      "yonder, each in our corner. There's a class instinct, too, of what one\n",
      "ought and oughtn't to do. There's the peasants, too, I wonder at them\n",
      "sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can. However\n",
      "bad the land is, he'll work it. Without a return too. At a simple loss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as we do,\" said Levin. \"Very, very glad to have met you,\" he\n",
      "added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And here we've met for the first time since we met at your place,\" said\n",
      "the landowner to Sviazhsky, \"and we've had a good talk too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?\" said Sviazhsky\n",
      "with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That we're bound to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've relieved your feelings?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Sviazhsky took Levin's arm, and went with him to his own friends. This\n",
      "time there was no avoiding Vronsky. He was standing with Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he\n",
      "drew near.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Delighted! I believe I've had the pleasure of meeting you ... at\n",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya's,\" he said, giving Levin his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I quite remember our meeting,\" said Levin, and blushing crimson,\n",
      "he turned away immediately, and began talking to his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously\n",
      "without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin.\n",
      "But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking round at\n",
      "Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his\n",
      "rudeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are we waiting for now?\" asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and\n",
      "Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For Snetkov. He has to refuse or to consent to stand,\" answered\n",
      "Sviazhsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and what has he done, consented or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the point, that he's done neither,\" said Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if he refuses, who will stand then?\" asked Levin, looking at\n",
      "Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoever chooses to,\" said Sviazhsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shall you?\" asked Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly not I,\" said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an\n",
      "alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who then? Nevyedovsky?\" said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot\n",
      "into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this was worse still. Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two\n",
      "candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,\" answered the malignant\n",
      "gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was Nevyedovsky himself. Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you find it exciting too?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at\n",
      "Vronsky. \"It's something like a race. One might bet on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is keenly exciting,\" said Vronsky. \"And once taking the thing\n",
      "up, one's eager to see it through. It's a fight!\" he said, scowling and\n",
      "setting his powerful jaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! Sees it all so clearly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes!\" Vronsky assented indifferently.\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence followed, during which Vronsky--since he had to look at\n",
      "something--looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his\n",
      "face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to\n",
      "say something:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice\n",
      "of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly\n",
      "institution,\" Levin answered gloomily. He had been all the time looking\n",
      "for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to\n",
      "smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think so, quite the contrary,\" Vronsky said, with quiet\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a plaything,\" Levin cut him short. \"We don't want justices of the\n",
      "peace. I've never had a single thing to do with them during eight years.\n",
      "And what I have had was decided wrongly by them. The justice of the\n",
      "peace is over thirty miles from me. For some matter of two roubles I\n",
      "should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and\n",
      "when the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander. All\n",
      "this was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as\n",
      "he said it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, this is such an original fellow!\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch with his\n",
      "most soothing, almond-oil smile. \"But come along; I think they're\n",
      "voting....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And they separated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't understand,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his\n",
      "brother's clumsiness, \"I can't understand how anyone can be so\n",
      "absolutely devoid of political tact. That's where we Russians are so\n",
      "deficient. The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him\n",
      "you're _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand. Count Vronsky, now ...\n",
      "I'm not making a friend of him; he's asked me to dinner, and I'm not\n",
      "going; but he's one of our side--why make an enemy of him? Then you ask\n",
      "Nevyedovsky if he's going to stand. That's not a thing to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't understand it at all! And it's all such nonsense,\" Levin\n",
      "answered gloomily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You say it's all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do\n",
      "with it, you make a muddle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air\n",
      "of some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called\n",
      "upon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand. All was\n",
      "silence in the room. The secretary announced in a loud voice that the\n",
      "captain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be\n",
      "balloted for as marshal of the province.\n",
      "\n",
      "The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from\n",
      "their tables to the high table, and the election began.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Put it in the right side,\" whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his\n",
      "brother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table. But\n",
      "Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to\n",
      "him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying \"the\n",
      "right side.\" Surely Snetkov was the enemy. As he went up, he held the\n",
      "ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box he\n",
      "changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left. An\n",
      "adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere action\n",
      "of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance. It was no\n",
      "good for him to use his insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard. Then a\n",
      "single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against. The\n",
      "marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority. All was noise and\n",
      "eager movement towards the doors. Snetkov came in, and the nobles\n",
      "thronged round him, congratulating him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now is it over?\" Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's only just beginning,\" Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch with a smile. \"Some other candidate may receive more votes\n",
      "than the marshal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin had quite forgotten about that. Now he could only remember that\n",
      "there was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think\n",
      "what it was exactly. He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the\n",
      "crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed\n",
      "him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments\n",
      "were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters.\n",
      "The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and Levin agreed.\n",
      "After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their\n",
      "former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the hall, where it was\n",
      "all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through the galleries. The\n",
      "galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the\n",
      "balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said\n",
      "below. With the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers, high\n",
      "school teachers in spectacles, and officers. Everywhere they were\n",
      "talking of the election, and of how worried the marshal was, and how\n",
      "splendid the discussions had been. In one group Levin heard his\n",
      "brother's praises. One lady was telling a lawyer:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It's worth losing one's dinner. He's\n",
      "exquisite! So clear and distinct all of it! There's not one of you in\n",
      "the law courts that speaks like that. The only one is Meidel, and he's\n",
      "not so eloquent by a long way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking\n",
      "and listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to\n",
      "their districts. In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform, who\n",
      "shouted in a loud, high voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we\n",
      "call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!\" A dead silence\n",
      "followed, and then a weak old voice was heard: \"Declined!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,\" the voice began\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Declined!\" a high boyish voice replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again it began, and again \"Declined.\" And so it went on for about an\n",
      "hour. Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened. At\n",
      "first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure\n",
      "that he could not make it out he began to be bored. Then recalling all\n",
      "the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces, he felt\n",
      "sad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs. As he passed\n",
      "through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy\n",
      "walking up and down with tired-looking eyes. On the stairs he met a\n",
      "couple--a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy\n",
      "prosecutor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you you weren't late,\" the deputy prosecutor was saying at the\n",
      "moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his\n",
      "waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary\n",
      "overtook him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so stoutly\n",
      "denied all idea of standing. Levin went up to the door of the room; it\n",
      "was locked. The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by\n",
      "two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't stand any more of it,\" said one red-faced gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out. His\n",
      "face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told you not to let any one out!\" he cried to the doorkeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I let someone in, your excellency!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy on us!\" and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked\n",
      "with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his legs\n",
      "staggering in his white trousers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he\n",
      "was the new marshal of the province. Many people were amused, many were\n",
      "pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and\n",
      "unhappy. The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair,\n",
      "which he could not conceal. When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the\n",
      "crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as they\n",
      "had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as they\n",
      "had followed Snetkov when he was elected.\n",

      "The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that\n",
      "day with Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the\n",
      "country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to\n",
      "repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he\n",
      "had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in\n",
      "order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner\n",
      "which he had taken upon himself. But he had not in the least expected\n",
      "that the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that\n",
      "he would be so good at this kind of thing. He was quite a new man in the\n",
      "circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was\n",
      "unmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already\n",
      "obtained a certain influence. This influence was due to his wealth and\n",
      "reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend\n",
      "Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director\n",
      "of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought\n",
      "from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a\n",
      "schoolfellow of Vronsky's--a schoolfellow he had patronized and\n",
      "protected indeed. But what contributed more than all to his success was\n",
      "his direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the\n",
      "majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed\n",
      "haughtiness. He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical\n",
      "gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _a propos de bottes_\n",
      "poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury,\n",
      "every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his\n",
      "adherent. He saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he\n",
      "had done a great deal to secure the success of Nevyedovsky. And now at\n",
      "his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky's election, he was experiencing\n",
      "an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate. The\n",
      "election itself had so fascinated him that, if he could succeed in\n",
      "getting married during the next three years, he began to think of\n",
      "standing himself--much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he\n",
      "had longed to ride a race himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey. Vronsky sat at the\n",
      "head of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general\n",
      "of high rank. To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who\n",
      "had solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a feeling\n",
      "of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he\n",
      "was little Katka Maslov--that had been his nickname in the Pages'\n",
      "Corps--whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre a son aise_. On the\n",
      "left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and malignant\n",
      "face. With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly. It was indeed no\n",
      "failure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to\n",
      "Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the\n",
      "new movement, which the nobility ought to follow. And so every honest\n",
      "person, as he said, was on the side of today's success and was rejoicing\n",
      "over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and\n",
      "that everyone was pleased. The episode of the elections served as a good\n",
      "occasion for a capital dinner. Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful\n",
      "discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his\n",
      "excellency would have to select another more complicated method of\n",
      "auditing the accounts than tears. Another nobleman jocosely described\n",
      "how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal's ball, and\n",
      "how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would\n",
      "give a ball with footmen in stockings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: \"our marshal,\" and\n",
      "\"your excellency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called\n",
      "\"Madame\" and her husband's name. Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely\n",
      "indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that he\n",
      "was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray\n",
      "the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the\n",
      "result of the election. And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good\n",
      "humor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: \"Nevyedovsky elected by\n",
      "twenty votes. Congratulations. Tell people.\" He dictated it aloud,\n",
      "saying: \"We must let them share our rejoicing.\" Darya Alexandrovna,\n",
      "getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and\n",
      "understood that it was an after-dinner affair. She knew Stiva had a\n",
      "weakness after dining for _faire jouer le telegraphe._\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from\n",
      "Russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely\n",
      "dignified, simple, and enjoyable. The party--some twenty--had been\n",
      "selected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of\n",
      "the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well\n",
      "bred. They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of\n",
      "the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of \"our amiable\n",
      "host.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vronsky was satisfied. He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone\n",
      "in the provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively. The governor asked\n",
      "Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his\n",
      "wife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There'll be a ball, and you'll see the belle of the province. Worth\n",
      "seeing, really.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not in my line,\" Vronsky answered. He liked that English phrase. But he\n",
      "smiled, and promised to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking,\n",

      "\n",
      "She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country. In\n",

      "in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place, he\n",
      "was never in haste to be off elsewhere. He was never unoccupied. Here in\n",
      "town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something,\n",
      "and yet he had nothing to do. And she felt sorry for him. To others, she\n",
      "knew, he did not appear an object of pity. On the contrary, when Kitty\n",
      "looked at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves,\n",
      "trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the\n",
      "impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of jealous\n",
      "fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he was\n",
      "very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather old-fashioned,\n",
      "reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and striking, as she\n",
      "thought, and expressive face. But she saw him not from without, but from\n",
      "within; she saw that here he was not himself; that was the only way she\n",
      "could define his condition to herself. Sometimes she inwardly reproached\n",
      "him for his inability to live in the town; sometimes she recognized that\n",
      "it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be\n",
      "satisfied with it.\n",

      "What had he to do, indeed? He did not care for cards; he did not go to a\n",
      "club. Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky's type--she\n",
      "knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere after\n",
      "drinking. She could not think without horror of where men went on such\n",
      "occasions. Was he to go into society? But she knew he could only find\n",
      "satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women,\n",
      "and that she could not wish for. Should he stay at home with her, her\n",

      "there left for him to do? To go on writing at his book he had indeed\n",
      "attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts\n",
      "and look up references for his book. But, as he told her, the more he\n",
      "did nothing, the less time he had to do anything. And besides, he\n",

      "ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary, exactly as she\n",

      "she saw the joke.) But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya\n",

      "meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the\n",

      "detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but that\n",
      "afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any\n",
      "chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of\n",

      "men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and\n",
      "winnowed and sifted and sown,--this next one he parted with more easily.\n",
      "And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and\n",
      "they flew off like little birds. Whether the labor devoted to obtaining\n",
      "the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it,\n",
      "was a consideration he had long ago dismissed. His business calculation\n",

      "on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers. Katavasov had\n",
      "heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite\n",

      "current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the\n",
      "Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and\n",

      "eastern--much the larger--part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for\n",

      "reading he had thought over their conversation. He saw distinctly now\n",
      "that though Metrov's ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas had a\n",
      "value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to\n",
      "something if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that nothing\n",
      "would be gained by putting their ideas together. And having made up his\n",
      "mind to refuse Metrov's invitation, Levin went up to him at the end of\n",

      "reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand\n",
      "he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his\n",
      "curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air,\n",
      "lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How's Kitty? Sit here, it's more\n",
      "comfortable.\" He got up and pushed up a rocking chair. \"Have you read\n",
      "the last circular in the _Journal de St. Petersbourg?_ I think it's\n",
      "excellent,\" he said, with a slight French accent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in\n",
      "Petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of\n",
      "his interview with Metrov, and the learned society's meeting. To Lvov it\n",
      "was very interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting\n",
      "scientific circles,\" he said. And as he talked, he passed as usual into\n",
      "French, which was easier to him. \"It's true I haven't the time for it.\n",
      "My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I'm not\n",
      "ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That I don't believe,\" said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always\n",
      "did, touched at Lvov's low opinion of himself, which was not in the\n",
      "least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely\n",
      "sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, indeed! I feel now how badly educated I am. To educate my\n",
      "children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply\n",
      "to study myself. For it's not enough to have teachers, there must be\n",
      "someone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and\n",
      "an overseer. See what I'm reading\"--he pointed to Buslaev's _Grammar_ on\n",
      "the desk--\"it's expected of Misha, and it's so difficult.... Come,\n",
      "explain to me.... Here he says...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin tried to explain to him that it couldn't be understood, but that\n",
      "it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you're laughing at it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the contrary, you can't imagine how, when I look at you, I'm always\n",
      "learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one's\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, there's nothing for you to learn,\" said Lvov.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All I know,\" said Levin, \"is that I have never seen better brought-up\n",
      "children than yours, and I wouldn't wish for children better than\n",
      "yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he was\n",
      "positively radiant with smiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If only they're better than I! That's all I desire. You don't know yet\n",
      "all the work,\" he said, \"with boys who've been left like mine to run\n",
      "wild abroad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll catch all that up. They're such clever children. The great thing\n",
      "is the education of character. That's what I learn when I look at your\n",
      "children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You talk of the education of character. You can't imagine how difficult\n",
      "that is! You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others\n",
      "crop up, and the struggle begins again. If one had not a support in\n",
      "religion--you remember we talked about that--no father could bring\n",
      "children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the\n",
      "entrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know you were here,\" she said, unmistakably feeling no regret,\n",
      "but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a topic\n",
      "she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it. \"Well, how is\n",
      "Kitty? I am dining with you today. I tell you what, Arseny,\" she turned\n",
      "to her husband, \"you take the carriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the\n",
      "day. As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business,\n",
      "while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a\n",
      "committee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider\n",
      "and settle. Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.\n",
      "It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the\n",
      "meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office\n",
      "for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty's; or that,\n",
      "if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage back and\n",
      "Levin would go with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's spoiling me,\" Lvov said to his wife; \"he assures me that our\n",
      "children are splendid, when I know how much that's bad there is in\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,\" said his wife. \"If you look for\n",
      "perfection, you will never be satisfied. And it's true, as papa\n",
      "says,--that when we were brought up there was one extreme--we were kept\n",
      "in the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it's\n",
      "just the other way--the parents are in the wash house, while the\n",
      "children are in the best rooms. Parents now are not expected to live at\n",
      "all, but to exist altogether for their children.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what if they like it better?\" Lvov said, with his beautiful\n",
      "smile, touching her hand. \"Anyone who didn't know you would think you\n",
      "were a stepmother, not a true mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, extremes are not good in anything,\" Natalia said serenely, putting\n",
      "his paper knife straight in its proper place on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, come here, you perfect children,\" Lvov said to the two handsome\n",

      "obviously wishing to ask him about something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to\n",

      "to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a\n",

      "sudden death of Madame Apraksina.\n",

      "At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were\n",
      "performed. One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette\n",
      "dedicated to the memory of Bach. Both were new and in the new style, and\n",
      "Levin was eager to form an opinion of them. After escorting his\n",
      "sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to\n",
      "listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible. He tried not to\n",
      "let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by\n",
      "looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always\n",
      "disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with\n",
      "strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either\n",
      "thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the\n",
      "music. He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative\n",
      "acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him,\n",
      "listening.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the more he listened to the fantasia of King Lear the further he\n",
      "felt from forming any definite opinion of it. There was, as it were, a\n",
      "continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some\n",
      "feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical\n",
      "motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly\n",
      "complex but disconnected sounds. And these fragmentary musical\n",
      "expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they\n",
      "were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything. Gaiety and grief\n",
      "and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any\n",
      "connection, like the emotions of a madman. And those emotions, like a\n",
      "madman's, sprang up quite unexpectedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching\n",
      "people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the\n",
      "fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain\n",
      "on his attention. Loud applause resounded on all sides. Everyone got up,\n",
      "moved about, and began talking. Anxious to throw some light on his own\n",
      "perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about,\n",
      "looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical\n",
      "amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marvelous!\" Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass. \"How are you,\n",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch? Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to\n",
      "say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia's\n",
      "approach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with\n",
      "fate. Isn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?\" Levin asked timidly,\n",
      "forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cordelia comes in ... see here!\" said Pestsov, tapping his finger on\n",
      "the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to\n",
      "Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to\n",
      "read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were\n",
      "printed on the back of the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't follow it without that,\" said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as\n",
      "the person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to\n",
      "talk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the _entr'acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the\n",
      "merits and defects of music of the Wagner school. Levin maintained that\n",
      "the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take\n",
      "music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it\n",
      "tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an\n",
      "instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble\n",
      "certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the\n",
      "pedestal. \"These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were\n",
      "positively clinging on the ladder,\" said Levin. The comparison pleased\n",
      "him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase\n",
      "before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest\n",
      "manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear. Pestsov, who\n",
      "was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time,\n",
      "condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of\n",
      "simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites\n",
      "in painting. As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom\n",
      "he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances. Among\n",
      "others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, go at once then,\" Madame Lvova said, when he told her; \"perhaps\n",

      "\n",
      "As he passed through the first drawing room Levin met in the doorway\n",
      "Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and\n",
      "severe face. On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the\n",
      "little drawing room, where he heard voices. In this room there were\n",
      "sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow\n",
      "colonel, whom Levin knew. Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down\n",
      "beside the sofa with his hat on his knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn't go. Mamma\n",
      "had to be at the funeral service.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his\n",
      "wife and inquired about the concert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina's sudden\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Lucca was very good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, very good,\" he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to\n",
      "him what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a\n",
      "hundred times about the characteristics of the singer's talent. Countess\n",
      "Bola pretended to be listening. Then, when he had said enough and\n",
      "paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk. The\n",
      "colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture. At last, after\n",
      "speaking of the proposed _folle journee_ at Turin's, the colonel\n",
      "laughed, got up noisily, and went away. Levin too rose, but he saw by\n",
      "the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go. He must\n",
      "stay two minutes longer. He sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not\n",
      "find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be very\n",
      "interesting,\" began the countess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I promised my _belle-soeur_ to fetch her from it,\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "A silence followed. The mother once more exchanged glances with a\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, now I think the time has come,\" thought Levin, and he got up. The\n",
      "ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _mille choses_ to his\n",
      "wife for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat, \"Where is your honor\n",
      "staying?\" and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely\n",
      "bound book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I don't care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid,\"\n",
      "thought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does\n",
      "it. He drove to the public meeting, where he was to find his\n",

      "\n",
      "At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people,\n",

      "which, as everyone said, was very interesting. When the reading of the\n",
      "report was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who\n",
      "invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the\n",
      "Society of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered,\n",
      "and Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and many\n",
      "other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on\n",
      "the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial. But, probably\n",
      "from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in\n",
      "speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times with\n",
      "vexation. Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been\n",
      "condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him by\n",
      "exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day before in\n",
      "conversation from an acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by\n",
      "putting it into the water,\" said Levin. Then he recollected that this\n",
      "idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own,\n",
      "came from a fable of Krilov's, and that the acquaintance had picked it\n",
      "up from a newspaper article.\n",
      "\n",
      "After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good\n",

      "and going into society. He remembered the club, the external details of\n",

      "made on him in old days. But as soon as, driving into the wide\n",
      "semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted the steps,\n",

      "All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter's room\n",
      "with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the\n",

      "the wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds\n",
      "of cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this\n",

      "\"Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she's exquisite!\" said Stepan\n",

      "and ends by becoming a _shlupik_. Ah, you laugh! but we look out, for\n",
      "fear of dropping into it ourselves. You know Prince Tchetchensky?\"\n",

      "\n",

      "where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting talking\n",
      "to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a recess, there\n",

      "peeped into the \"infernal regions,\" where a good many men were crowding\n",
      "round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting. Trying not to make a\n",
      "noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under the shaded\n",
      "lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning over\n",
      "one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book. They\n",
      "went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual room, where\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Prince, please come, we're ready,\" said one of his card party, who had\n",

      "listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all\n",
      "of a sudden fearfully bored. He got up hurriedly, and went to look for\n",
      "Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and\n",

      "not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he had\n",
      "been drinking, or when he was touched. Just now it was due to both\n",
      "causes. \"Levin, don't go,\" he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm above\n",
      "the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a true friend of mine--almost my greatest friend,\" he said to\n",

      "Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were\n",
      "incessantly coming up to him. Every now and then he went to the\n",

      "sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning. He was glad\n",
      "that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace,\n",
      "decorum, and comfort never left him.\n",

      "still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose, comfort, and\n",
      "unimpeachable good form. But as soon as the carriage drove out into the\n",
      "street, and he felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry\n",
      "shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light\n",
      "the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated,\n",
      "and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was\n",

      "business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging\n",
      "on for three months past. As soon as the divorce is over, she will marry\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's a long and tedious story! The whole business is in such an\n",
      "anomalous position with us. But the point is she has been for three\n",
      "months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce; she\n",
      "goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you\n",
      "understand, she doesn't care to have people come as a favor. That fool\n",
      "Princess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of\n",

      "hear about her. She's busy, in the first place, with what she writes. I\n",
      "see you're smiling ironically, but you're wrong. She's writing a\n",

      "trainer, an Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard. He's\n",
      "completely given up to drink--delirium tremens--and the family were cast\n",
      "on the world. She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested in\n",
      "them, and now the whole family is on her hands. But not by way of\n",
      "patronage, you know, helping with money; she's herself preparing the\n",

      "Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke. \"We were just\n",

      "\"She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high school\n",
      "people on Grisha's account. The Latin teacher, it seems, had been unfair\n",
      "to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have seen his pictures. I didn't care for them very much,\" Levin\n",
      "went back to the subject she had started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to\n",
      "the subject with which he had been talking all the morning. Every word\n",
      "in his conversation with her had a special significance. And talking to\n",
      "her was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and\n",
      "carelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight\n",
      "to the ideas of the person she was talking to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new\n",
      "illustrations of the Bible by a French artist. Vorkuev attacked the\n",
      "artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than\n",
      "anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to\n",

      "\n",
      "Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I laugh,\" she said, \"as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.\n",
      "What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and\n",
      "literature too, indeed--Zola, Daudet. But perhaps it is always so, that\n",
      "men form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and\n",
      "then--all the _combinaisons_ made--they are tired of the fictitious\n",
      "figures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, this is a woman!\" Levin thought, forgetting himself and\n",
      "staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment\n",
      "was all at once completely transformed. Levin did not hear what she was\n",
      "talking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was struck by the\n",
      "change of her expression. Her face--so handsome a moment before in its\n",
      "repose--suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride. But\n",
      "this lasted only an instant. She dropped her eyelids, as though\n",
      "recollecting something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, but that's of no interest to anyone,\" she said, and she\n",
      "turned to the English girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please order the tea in the drawing room,\" she said in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl got up and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, how did she get through her examination?\" asked Stepan\n",
      "Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendidly! She's a very gifted child and a sweet character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will end in your loving her more than your own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There a man speaks. In love there's no more nor less. I love my\n",
      "daughter with one love, and her with another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,\" said Vorkuev, \"that if she were to\n",
      "put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl to\n",
      "the public question of the education of Russian children, she would be\n",
      "doing a great and useful work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I can't help it; I couldn't do it. Count Alexey Kirillovitch\n",
      "urged me very much\" (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey\n",
      "Kirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he\n",
      "unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look); \"he\n",
      "urged me to take up the school in the village. I visited it several\n",
      "times. The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the\n",
      "work. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and come as it will,\n",
      "there's no forcing it. I took to this child--I could not myself say\n",
      "why.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she glanced again at Levin. And her smile and her glance--all told\n",
      "him that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his\n",
      "good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood\n",
      "each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I quite understand that,\" Levin answered. \"It's impossible to give\n",
      "one's heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe\n",
      "that's just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor\n",
      "results.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was silent for a while, then she smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" she agreed; \"I never could. _Je n'ai pas le coeur assez_\n",
      "large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls. _Cela ne m'a jamais\n",
      "reussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une position\n",
      "sociale_ in that way. And now more than ever,\" she said with a mournful,\n",
      "confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but\n",
      "unmistakably intending her words only for Levin, \"now when I have such\n",
      "need of some occupation, I cannot.\" And suddenly frowning (Levin saw\n",
      "that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed\n",
      "the subject. \"I know about you,\" she said to Levin; \"that you're not a\n",
      "public-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my\n",
      "ability.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How have you defended me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, according to the attacks made on you. But won't you have some tea?\"\n",
      "She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,\" said Vorkuev, indicating the book.\n",
      "\"It's well worth taking up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, it's all so sketchy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told him about it,\" Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his sister, nodding\n",
      "at Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shouldn't have. My writing is something after the fashion of those\n",
      "little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from\n",
      "the prisons. She had the direction of the prison department in that\n",
      "society,\" she turned to Levin; \"and they were miracles of patience, the\n",
      "work of those poor wretches.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so\n",
      "extraordinarily. Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth. She had\n",
      "no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position. As she said\n",
      "that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression, looked\n",
      "as it were turned to stone. With that expression on her face she was\n",
      "more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was utterly\n",
      "unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating happiness,\n",
      "which had been caught by the painter in her portrait. Levin looked more\n",
      "than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her brother's arm\n",
      "she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her a tenderness\n",
      "and pity at which he wondered himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing room, while she\n",
      "stayed behind to say a few words to her brother. \"About her divorce,\n",
      "about Vronsky, and what he's doing at the club, about me?\" wondered\n",
      "Levin. And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was\n",
      "saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely heard what Vorkuev was\n",
      "telling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna\n",
      "had written.\n",
      "\n",
      "At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter,\n",
      "continued. There was not a single instant when a subject for\n",
      "conversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had\n",
      "hardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear\n",
      "what the others were saying. And all that was said, not only by her, but\n",
      "by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch--all, so it seemed to Levin, gained\n",
      "peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism. While he\n",
      "followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time admiring\n",
      "her--her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the same time her\n",
      "directness and genuine depth of feeling. He listened and talked, and all\n",
      "the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to divine her\n",
      "feelings. And though he had judged her so severely hitherto, now by some\n",
      "strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was also sorry for\n",
      "her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand her. At eleven\n",
      "o'clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go (Vorkuev had left\n",
      "earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just come. Regretfully\n",
      "Levin too rose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good-bye,\" she said, holding his hand and glancing into his face with a\n",
      "winning look. \"I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot pardon\n",
      "me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never pardon it. To\n",
      "pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through, and may God\n",
      "spare her that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly, yes, I will tell her...\" Levin said, blushing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!\" he was thinking, as he\n",
      "stepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, didn't I tell you?\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin\n",
      "had been completely won over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Levin dreamily, \"an extraordinary woman! It's not her\n",
      "cleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling. I'm awfully\n",
      "sorry for her!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, please God, everything will soon be settled. Well, well, don't be\n",
      "hard on people in future,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the\n",
      "carriage door. \"Good-bye; we don't go the same way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in their\n",
      "conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her\n",
      "expression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling\n",
      "sympathy for her, Levin reached home.\n",
      "\n",
      "At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and\n",
      "that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two letters.\n",
      "Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not over look them\n",
      "later. One was from Sokolov, his bailiff. Sokolov wrote that the corn\n",
      "could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a half roubles,\n",
      "and that more than that could not be got for it. The other letter was\n",
      "from his sister. She scolded him for her business being still unsettled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can't get more,\" Levin\n",
      "decided the first question, which had always before seemed such a\n",
      "weighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot. \"It's\n",
      "extraordinary how all one's time is taken up here,\" he thought,\n",
      "considering the second letter. He felt himself to blame for not having\n",
      "got done what his sister had asked him to do for her. \"Today, again,\n",
      "I've not been to the court, but today I've certainly not had time.\" And\n",
      "resolving that he would not fail to do it next day, he went up to his\n",
      "wife. As he went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had\n",
      "spent. All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he\n",
      "had heard and taken part in. All the conversations were upon subjects\n",
      "which, if he had been alone at home, he would never have taken up, but\n",
      "here they were very interesting. And all these conversations were right\n",
      "enough, only in two places there was something not quite right. One was\n",
      "what he had said about the carp, the other was something not \"quite the\n",
      "thing\" in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull. The dinner of the three\n",
      "sisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for\n",
      "him, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had\n",
      "been left alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and what have you been doing?\" she asked him, looking straight\n",
      "into his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness. But that\n",
      "she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed her\n",
      "close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his\n",
      "account of how he had spent the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm very glad I met Vronsky. I felt quite at ease and natural\n",
      "with him. You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I'm glad that\n",
      "this awkwardness is all over,\" he said, and remembering that by way of\n",
      "trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he\n",
      "blushed. \"We talk about the peasants drinking; I don't know which drinks\n",
      "most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays,\n",
      "but...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking\n",
      "habits of the peasants. She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know\n",
      "why.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, and then where did you go?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to\n",
      "whether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for\n",
      "all. He knew now that he ought not to have done so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty's eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna's name, but\n",
      "controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" was all she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure you won't be angry at my going. Stiva begged me to, and Dolly\n",
      "wished it,\" Levin went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no!\" she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him\n",
      "no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,\" he said, telling\n",
      "her about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to\n",
      "her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,\" said Kitty, when he had\n",
      "finished. \"Whom was your letter from?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair. When he went up to\n",
      "her, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What? what is it?\" he asked, knowing beforehand what.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you! I saw it\n",
      "in your eyes. Yes, yes! What can it all lead to? You were drinking at\n",

      "people! No, we must go away.... I shall go away tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife. At last he\n",
      "succeeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in\n",
      "conjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that\n",
      "he had succumbed to Anna's artful influence, and that he would avoid\n",
      "her. One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so\n",
      "long in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and drinking,\n",
      "he was degenerating. They talked till three o'clock in the morning. Only\n",

      "fallen into doing with all young men--and she knew she had attained her\n",

      "If he had been told it was only ten o'clock in the morning, he would not\n",

      "done for her sake, and only later on he found it was his own bed he had\n",
      "been getting ready. Then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctor\n",
      "something. The doctor had answered and then had said something about the\n",
      "irregularities in the municipal council. Then he had been sent to the\n",
      "bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver\n",

      "clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the\n",

      "tucking it in behind the pillow. But where, when, and why all this had\n",
      "happened, he could not tell. He did not understand why the old princess\n",
      "took his hand, and looking compassionately at him, begged him not to\n",
      "worry himself, and Dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out\n",

      "Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about\n",
      "politics, about Marya Petrovna's illness, and where Levin suddenly\n",
      "forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked\n",
      "up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his\n",
      "heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic\n",
      "suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing. And every time he was\n",
      "brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the\n",
      "bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the\n",
      "first minute. Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped up, ran to justify\n",
      "himself, remembered on the way that he was not to blame, and he longed\n",
      "to defend her, to help her. But as he looked at her, he saw again that\n",
      "help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed: \"Lord,\n",
      "have mercy on us, and help us!\" And as time went on, both these\n",
      "conditions became more intense; the calmer he became away from her,\n",
      "completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both her sufferings\n",
      "and his feeling of helplessness before them. He jumped up, would have\n",
      "liked to run away, but ran to her.\n",

      "Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but\n",

      "He did not know whether it was late or early. The candles had all burned\n",
      "out. Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor\n",
      "that he should lie down. Levin sat listening to the doctor's stories of\n",
      "a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette. There had\n",
      "been a period of repose, and he had sunk into oblivion. He had\n",
      "completely forgotten what was going on now. He heard the doctor's chat\n",
      "and understood it. Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek. The shriek\n",
      "was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath,\n",
      "gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor. The doctor put his head on one\n",
      "side, listened, and smiled approvingly. Everything was so extraordinary\n",
      "that nothing could strike Levin as strange. \"I suppose it must be so,\"\n",

      "up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the\n",

      "subsided, but there was some change now. What it was he did not see and\n",
      "did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see or comprehend. But he saw\n",
      "it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna. Lizaveta Petrovna's face was stern\n",
      "and pale, and still as resolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her\n",
      "eyes were fixed intently on Kitty. Kitty's swollen and agonized face, a\n",
      "tress of hair clinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought\n",

      "face was drawn, she pushed him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, this is awful! I'm dying, I'm dying! Go away!\" she shrieked, and\n",
      "again he heard that unearthly scream.\n",

      "what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks. He had long ago ceased\n",
      "to wish for the child. By now he loathed this child. He did not even\n",
      "wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's the end,\" said the doctor. And the doctor's face was so grave as\n",
      "he said it that Levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom. The first thing he saw was the\n",
      "face of Lizaveta Petrovna. It was even more frowning and stern. Kitty's\n",
      "face he did not know. In the place where it had been was something that\n",
      "was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from\n",
      "it. He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed,\n",
      "feeling that his heart was bursting. The awful scream never paused, it\n",
      "became still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit\n",
      "of terror, suddenly it ceased. Levin could not believe his ears, but\n",
      "there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued\n",
      "stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive,\n",
      "tender, and blissful, uttered softly, \"It's over!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He lifted his head. With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt,\n",

      "\n",
      "And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he\n",

      "an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though now,\n",
      "by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it. The strained\n",
      "chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose\n",
      "up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for long they\n",
      "prevented him from speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife's hand before his\n",

      "the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp,\n",
      "lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and\n",

      "live and create in its own image.\n",
      "\n",

      "If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died\n",
      "with her, and that their children were angels, and that God was standing\n",
      "before him, he would have been surprised at nothing. But now, coming\n",
      "back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental efforts to\n",
      "take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so\n",
      "desperately was his son. Kitty was alive, her agony was over. And he was\n",
      "unutterably happy. That he understood; he was completely happy in it.\n",
      "But the baby? Whence, why, who was he?... He could not get used to the\n",

      "unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had been\n",
      "up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been yesterday till\n",
      "that point. It was as though a hundred years had passed since then. He\n",
      "felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he studiously\n",
      "lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking to. He\n",
      "talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her condition now,\n",
      "of his son, in whose existence he tried to school himself into\n",

      "that he could not take it in in his imagination. He heard them talk of\n",

      "before, brightened still more as he drew near her. There was the same\n",
      "change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the\n",
      "dead. But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome. Again a rush of\n",
      "emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child's birth, flooded\n",
      "his heart. She took his hand and asked him if he had slept. He could not\n",
      "answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.\n",
      "\n",

      "a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with\n",
      "little toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from\n",
      "the rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open little\n",
      "hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen\n",

      "\"Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they\n",
      "stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that must be a serious matter,\" said Stepan Arkadyevitch, watching\n",
      "with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother's; not childish\n",
      "now--no longer fully innocent. And though he had promised Alexey\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Do you remember your mother?\" he asked suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" Seryozha said quickly. He blushed crimson, and his face\n",
      "clouded over. And his uncle could get nothing more out of him. His tutor\n",
      "found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a long\n",
      "while he could not make out whether he was ill-tempered or crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it? I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?\" said the\n",

      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg. In\n",
      "Petersburg, besides business, his sister's divorce, and his coveted\n",

      "\n",
      "In spite of its _cafes chantants_ and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a\n",
      "stagnant bog. Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it. After living for some\n",
      "time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he was\n",
      "conscious of a depression of spirits. After being a long time in Moscow\n",
      "without a change, he reached a point when he positively began to be\n",
      "worrying himself over his wife's ill-humor and reproaches, over his\n",
      "children's health and education, and the petty details of his official\n",
      "work; even the fact of being in debt worried him. But he had only to go\n",
      "and stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he\n",
      "moved, where people lived--really lived--instead of vegetating as in\n",
      "Moscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax\n",
      "before the fire. His wife?... Only that day he had been talking to\n",
      "Prince Tchetchensky. Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family, grown-up\n",
      "pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate family of\n",
      "children also. Though the first family was very nice too, Prince\n",
      "Tchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his\n",
      "eldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch\n",
      "that he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas. What would\n",
      "have been said to that in Moscow?\n",
      "\n",
      "His children? In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from\n",
      "enjoying life. The children were brought up in schools, and there was no\n",

      "for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the children, while\n",
      "the parents have nothing but work and anxiety. Here people understood\n",
      "that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as every man of culture\n",
      "should live.\n",
      "\n",
      "His official duties? Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless\n",
      "drudgery that it was in Moscow. Here there was some interest in official\n",
      "life. A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a knack of\n",
      "facetious mimicry, and a man's career might be made in a trice. So it\n",

      "\n",

      "he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself,\n",
      "as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought\n",
      "her positively disagreeable. What made it hard to change the\n",
      "conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her. So that he\n",

      "wouldn't be deceitful, and she did a fine thing. And she did better\n",
      "still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours. You must excuse\n",
      "me. Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I was the\n",

      "just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in him, and\n",

      "general rush to him, and he's begun doctoring everyone. He cured\n",

      "in the circles he knew and was at home in. In these unfamiliar\n",

      "The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all\n",

      "on the lookout for it. At the slightest hint she transferred her\n",
      "jealousy from one object to another. At one time she was jealous of\n",
      "those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor\n",

      "would have rescued her from it. For her being in Moscow and not in the\n",
      "country, he was to blame too. He could not live buried in the country as\n",
      "she would have liked to do. He must have society, and he had put her in\n",

      "their yesterday's quarrel. Going back from the well-remembered,\n",

      "so little moment to either. But so it actually had been. It all arose\n",
      "from his laughing at the girls' high schools, declaring they were\n",
      "useless, while she defended them. He had spoken slightingly of women's\n",

      "had not the slightest need to know anything of physics.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Today he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and\n",
      "wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Unnatural!\" She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of\n",
      "all, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which\n",
      "it was said. \"I know what he meant; he meant--unnatural, not loving my\n",
      "own daughter, to love another person's child. What does he know of love\n",
      "for children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I've sacrificed for him? But\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute! The day after tomorrow's Sunday, I have\n",
      "to be at maman's,\" said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he\n",
      "uttered his mother's name he was aware of her intent, suspicious eyes.\n",
      "His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion. She flushed hotly and drew\n",
      "away from him. It was now not the Queen of Sweden's swimming-mistress\n",
      "who filled Anna's imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina. She was\n",
      "staying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"What for?\" said Vronsky, as though in amazement. \"Why, there's no\n",
      "meaning in it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me. You\n",
      "don't care to understand my life. The one thing that I cared for here\n",
      "was Hannah. You say it's affectation. Why, you said yesterday that I\n",
      "don't love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it's\n",
      "unnatural. I should like to know what life there is for me that could be\n",
      "natural!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was\n",
      "horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution. But even\n",
      "though she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself,\n",
      "could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not\n",
      "give way to him.\n",
      "\n",

      "the truth?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never boast, and I never tell lies,\" he said slowly, restraining his\n",
      "rising anger. \"It's a great pity if you can't respect...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be. And\n",

      "so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, this is becoming unbearable!\" cried Vronsky, getting up from his\n",
      "chair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking deliberately:\n",
      "\"What do you try my patience for?\" looking as though he might have said\n",
      "much more, but was restraining himself. \"It has limits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\" she cried, looking with terror at the\n",
      "undisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel,\n",
      "menacing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean to say...\" he was beginning, but he checked himself. \"I must ask\n",
      "what it is you want of me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What can I want? All I can want is that you should not desert me, as\n",
      "you think of doing,\" she said, understanding all he had not uttered.\n",
      "\"But that I don't want; that's secondary. I want love, and there is\n",
      "none. So then all is over.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Stop! sto-op!\" said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his\n",
      "brows, though he held her by the hand. \"What is it all about? I said\n",
      "that we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I was\n",
      "lying, that I was not an honorable man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having sacrificed\n",
      "everything for me,\" she said, recalling the words of a still earlier\n",

      "man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there are limits to endurance!\" he cried, and hastily let go her\n",
      "hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He hates me, that's clear,\" she thought, and in silence, without\n",
      "looking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room. \"He\n",
      "loves another woman, that's even clearer,\" she said to herself as she\n",
      "went into her own room. \"I want love, and there is none. So, then, all\n",
      "is over.\" She repeated the words she had said, \"and it must be ended.\"\n",

      "alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether\n",
      "reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at\n",
      "Petersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would\n",
      "look at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this\n",
      "rupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them\n",
      "with all her heart. At the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea\n",
      "that alone interested her, but she could not get clear sight of it.\n",
      "Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled the time of\n",
      "her illness after her confinement, and the feeling which never left her\n",
      "at that time. \"Why didn't I die?\" and the words and the feeling of that\n",
      "time came back to her. And all at once she knew what was in her soul.\n",
      "Yes, it was that idea which alone solved all. \"Yes, to die!... And the\n",
      "shame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my\n",
      "awful shame, it will all be saved by death. To die! and he will feel\n",
      "remorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.\"\n",
      "With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in\n",
      "the armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand,\n",
      "vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approaching footsteps--his steps--distracted her attention. As though\n",
      "absorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anna, we'll go the day after tomorrow, if you like. I agree to\n",
      "everything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it?\" he urged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know,\" she said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain\n",
      "herself any longer, she burst into sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cast me off!\" she articulated between her sobs. \"I'll go away tomorrow\n",
      "... I'll do more. What am I? An immoral woman! A stone round your neck.\n",
      "I don't want to make you wretched, I don't want to! I'll set you free.\n",
      "You don't love me; you love someone else!\"\n",

      "Vronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace of\n",

      "cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anna, why distress yourself and me so?\" he said to her, kissing her\n",

      "the sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her hand. And\n",
      "instantly Anna's despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of\n",
      "tenderness. She put her arms round him, and covered with kisses his\n",

      "whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way\n",
      "to the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent whether\n",
      "they went a day earlier or later. She was standing in her room over an\n",

      "went up to the pier glass to see whether she really had done her hair.\n",
      "She certainly had, but she could not think when she had done it. \"Who's\n",
      "that?\" she thought, looking in the looking glass at the swollen face\n",
      "with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her.\n",
      "\"Why, it's I!\" she suddenly understood, and looking round, she seemed\n",

      "with me?\" She went to the window and began looking into the street.\n",
      "Judging by the time, he might be back now. But her calculations might be\n",
      "wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to\n",
      "count the minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it\n",
      "with her watch, someone drove up. Glancing out of the window, she saw\n",

      "that's true or else I shall go out of my mind. Yes, and I can telegraph,\n",
      "too.\" And she wrote a telegram. \"I absolutely must talk to you; come at\n",
      "once.\" After sending off the telegram, she went to dress. When she was\n",
      "dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He writes that he can't make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch\n",
      "wants, but he won't go away without a decisive answer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you had someone with you. Can I see the letter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Kitty,\" said Dolly, embarrassed. \"She stayed in the nursery. She\n",
      "has been very ill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I heard. May I see the letter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll get it directly. But he doesn't refuse; on the contrary, Stiva has\n",
      "hopes,\" said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I haven't, and indeed I don't wish it,\" said Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's this? Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?\" thought Anna\n",
      "when she was alone. \"Perhaps she's right, too. But it's not for her, the\n",
      "girl who was in love with Vronsky, it's not for her to show me that,\n",
      "even if it is true. I know that in my position I can't be received by\n",
      "any decent woman. I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed\n",
      "everything to him. And this is my reward! Oh, how I hate him! And what\n",
      "did I come here for? I'm worse here, more miserable.\" She heard from the\n",
      "next room the sisters' voices in consultation. \"And what am I going to\n",
      "say to Dolly now? Amuse Kitty by the sight of my wretchedness, submit to\n",
      "her patronizing? No; and besides, Dolly wouldn't understand. And it\n",
      "would be no good my telling her. It would only be interesting to see\n",
      "Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone and everything, how nothing\n",
      "matters to me now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dolly came in with the letter. Anna read it and handed it back in\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, why so? On the contrary, I have hopes,\" said Dolly, looking\n",
      "inquisitively at Anna. She had never seen her in such a strangely\n",
      "irritable condition. \"When are you going away?\" she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why does Kitty shrink from me?\" she said, looking at the door and\n",
      "flushing red.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what nonsense! She's nursing, and things aren't going right with\n",
      "her, and I've been advising her.... She's delighted. She'll be here in a\n",
      "minute,\" said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying. \"Yes, here she is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly\n",
      "persuaded her. Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I am so glad to see you,\" she said with a trembling voice.\n",

      "soon as she saw Anna's lovely and attractive face, all feeling of\n",
      "antagonism disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. I'm\n",
      "used to everything. You have been ill? Yes, you are changed,\" said Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. She ascribed\n",
      "this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once\n",
      "patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked of Kitty's illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was\n",
      "obvious that nothing interested Anna.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I came to say good-bye to you,\" she said, getting up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, when are you going?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,\" she said with a smile. \"I have\n",
      "heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. He came to\n",
      "see me, and I liked him exceedingly,\" she said, unmistakably with\n",
      "malicious intent. \"Where is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has gone back to the country,\" said Kitty, blushing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Remember me to him, be sure you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be sure to!\" Kitty said naively, looking compassionately into her\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So good-bye, Dolly.\" And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty,\n",
      "Anna went out hurriedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's just the same and just as charming! She's very lovely!\" said\n",
      "Kitty, when she was alone with her sister. \"But there's something\n",
      "piteous about her. Awfully piteous!\"\n",

      "Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than\n",
      "when she set out from home. To her previous tortures was added now that\n",
      "sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so\n",
      "distinctly on meeting Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where to? Home?\" asked Pyotr.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, home,\" she said, not even thinking now where she was going.\n",

      "\"How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and\n",
      "curious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?\" she\n",
      "thought, staring at two men who walked by. \"Can one ever tell anyone\n",
      "what one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly, and it's a good thing I\n",
      "didn't tell her. How pleased she would have been at my misery! She would\n",
      "have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight at my\n",
      "being punished for the happiness she envied me for. Kitty, she would\n",
      "have been even more pleased. How I can see through her! She knows I was\n",
      "more than usually sweet to her husband. And she's jealous and hates me.\n",
      "And she despises me. In her eyes I'm an immoral woman. If I were an\n",
      "immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with me ... if\n",
      "I'd cared to. And, indeed, I did care to. There's someone who's pleased\n",
      "with himself,\" she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming\n",
      "towards her. He took her for an acquaintance, and lifted his glossy hat\n",
      "above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived his mistake. \"He thought\n",
      "he knew me. Well, he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me. I\n",
      "don't know myself. I know my appetites, as the French say. They want\n",
      "that dirty ice cream, that they do know for certain,\" she thought,\n",
      "looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a barrel off\n",
      "his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel. \"We all want\n",
      "what is sweet and nice. If not sweetmeats, then a dirty ice. And Kitty's\n",
      "the same--if not Vronsky, then Levin. And she envies me, and hates me.\n",
      "And we all hate each other. I Kitty, Kitty me. Yes, that's the truth.\n",
      "'_Tiutkin, coiffeur._' _Je me fais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I'll tell\n",
      "him that when he comes,\" she thought and smiled. But the same instant\n",
      "she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to. \"And\n",
      "there's nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really. It's all hateful.\n",
      "They're singing for vespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses\n",
      "himself! as if he were afraid of missing something. Why these churches\n",
      "and this singing and this humbug? Simply to conceal that we all hate\n",
      "each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily.\n",
      "Yashvin says, 'He wants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.' Yes,\n",
      "that's the truth!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left\n",
      "off thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the steps\n",
      "of her house. It was only when she saw the porter running out to meet\n",
      "her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is there an answer?\" she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll see this minute,\" answered the porter, and glancing into his room,\n",
      "he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram. \"I\n",
      "can't come before ten o'clock.--Vronsky,\" she read.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And hasn't the messenger come back?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" answered the porter.\n",

      "upstairs. \"I'll go to him myself. Before going away forever, I'll tell\n",
      "him all. Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!\" she thought.\n",
      "Seeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered with aversion. She did not\n",
      "consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he had\n",
      "not yet received her note. She pictured him to herself as talking calmly\n",
      "to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings.\n",
      "\"Yes, I must go quickly,\" she said, not knowing yet where she was going.\n",
      "She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had\n",
      "gone through in that awful house. The servants, the walls, the things in\n",
      "that house--all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a\n",
      "weight upon her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he's not there, then go\n",
      "there and catch him.\" Anna looked at the railway timetable in the\n",
      "newspapers. An evening train went at two minutes past eight. \"Yes, I\n",
      "shall be in time.\" She gave orders for the other horses to be put in the\n",
      "carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few\n",
      "days. She knew she would never come back here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that\n",
      "after what would happen at the station or at the countess's house, she\n",
      "would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and\n",
      "cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting. She\n",
      "ordered the carriage and went out. The house threw a shadow now right\n",
      "across the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the\n",
      "sunshine. Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put\n",
      "the things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor,\n",
      "were all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.\n",

      "\"But how about the ticket?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, as you like, it doesn't matter,\" she said crossly.\n",

      "\"Here it is again! Again I understand it all!\" Anna said to herself, as\n",
      "soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the\n",
      "tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed\n",
      "rapidly upon another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?\" she tried to\n",
      "recall it. \"'_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_'--no, not that. Yes, of what Yashvin\n",
      "says, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds\n",
      "men together. No, it's a useless journey you're making,\" she said,\n",
      "mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an\n",
      "excursion into the country. \"And the dog you're taking with you will be\n",
      "no help to you. You can't get away from yourselves.\" Turning her eyes in\n",
      "the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she saw a factory hand almost\n",
      "dead drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman. \"Come,\n",
      "he's found a quicker way,\" she thought. \"Count Vronsky and I did not\n",
      "find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.\" And now\n",
      "for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she was\n",
      "seeing everything on to her relations with him, which she had hitherto\n",
      "avoided thinking about. \"What was it he sought in me? Not love so much\n",
      "as the satisfaction of vanity.\" She remembered his words, the expression\n",
      "of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the early days of\n",
      "their connection. And everything now confirmed this. \"Yes, there was the\n",
      "triumph of success in him. Of course there was love too, but the chief\n",
      "element was the pride of success. He boasted of me. Now that's over.\n",
      "There's nothing to be proud of. Not to be proud of, but to be ashamed\n",
      "of. He has taken from me all he could, and now I am no use to him. He is\n",
      "weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me.\n",
      "He let that out yesterday--he wants divorce and marriage so as to burn\n",
      "his ships. He loves me, but how? The zest is gone, as the English say.\n",
      "That fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with\n",
      "himself,\" she thought, looking at a red-faced clerk, riding on a riding\n",
      "school horse. \"Yes, there's not the same flavor about me for him now. If\n",
      "I go away from him, at the bottom of his heart he will be glad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing\n",
      "light, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human\n",
      "relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is waning\n",
      "and waning, and that's why we're drifting apart.\" She went on musing.\n",
      "\"And there's no help for it. He is everything for me, and I want him\n",
      "more and more to give himself up to me entirely. And he wants more and\n",
      "more to get away from me. We walked to meet each other up to the time of\n",
      "our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different\n",
      "directions. And there's no altering that. He tells me I'm insanely\n",
      "jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous; but it's not\n",
      "true. I'm not jealous, but I'm unsatisfied. But...\" she opened her lips,\n",
      "and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the\n",
      "thought that suddenly struck her. \"If I could be anything but a\n",
      "mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his caresses; but I can't\n",
      "and I don't care to be anything else. And by that desire I rouse\n",
      "aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it cannot be different.\n",
      "Don't I know that he wouldn't deceive me, that he has no schemes about\n",
      "Princess Sorokina, that he's not in love with Kitty, that he won't\n",
      "desert me! I know all that, but it makes it no better for me. If without\n",
      "loving me, from _duty_ he'll be good and kind to me, without what I\n",
      "want, that's a thousand times worse than unkindness! That's--hell! And\n",
      "that's just how it is. For a long while now he hasn't loved me. And\n",
      "where love ends, hate begins. I don't know these streets at all. Hills\n",
      "it seems, and still houses, and houses .... And in the houses always\n",
      "people and people.... How many of them, no end, and all hating each\n",
      "other! Come, let me try and think what I want, to make me happy. Well?\n",
      "Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey Alexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha,\n",
      "and I marry Vronsky.\" Thinking of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she at once\n",
      "pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before\n",
      "her, with his mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white\n",
      "hands, his intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering\n",
      "the feeling which had existed between them, and which was also called\n",
      "love, she shuddered with loathing. \"Well, I'm divorced, and become\n",
      "Vronsky's wife. Well, will Kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me\n",
      "today? No. And will Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two\n",
      "husbands? And is there any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and\n",
      "me? Is there possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery?\n",
      "No, no!\" she answered now without the slightest hesitation. \"Impossible!\n",
      "We are drawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and\n",
      "there's no altering him or me. Every attempt has been made, the screw\n",
      "has come unscrewed. Oh, a beggar woman with a baby. She thinks I'm sorry\n",
      "for her. Aren't we all flung into the world only to hate each other, and\n",
      "so to torture ourselves and each other? Schoolboys coming--laughing\n",
      "Seryozha?\" she thought. \"I thought, too, that I loved him, and used to\n",
      "be touched by my own tenderness. But I have lived without him, I gave\n",
      "him up for another love, and did not regret the exchange till that love\n",
      "was satisfied.\" And with loathing she thought of what she meant by that\n",
      "love. And the clearness with which she saw life now, her own and all\n",
      "men's, was a pleasure to her. \"It's so with me and Pyotr, and the\n",
      "coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the people living along the\n",
      "Volga, where those placards invite one to go, and everywhere and\n",

      "Making her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she\n",

      "between which she was hesitating. And again at the old sore places, hope\n",
      "and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully\n",
      "throbbing heart. As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the\n",
      "train, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they were\n",
      "all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the station,\n",

      "at this moment complaining to his mother of his position, not\n",
      "understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room, and\n",
      "what she would say to him. Then she thought that life might still be\n",

      "anyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of\n",
      "the empty carriage. A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a\n",
      "cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that\n",
      "window, stooping down to the carriage wheels. \"There's something\n",
      "familiar about that hideous peasant,\" thought Anna. And remembering her\n",
      "dream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror. The\n",
      "conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you wish to get out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna made no answer. The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did not\n",
      "notice under her veil her panic-stricken face. She went back to her\n",
      "corner and sat down. The couple seated themselves on the opposite side,\n",
      "and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes. Both husband\n",
      "and wife seemed repulsive to Anna. The husband asked, would she allow\n",
      "him to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into\n",
      "conversation with her. Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in\n",
      "French something about caring less to smoke than to talk. They made\n",
      "inane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.\n",
      "Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each\n",
      "other. And no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise,\n",
      "shouting and laughter. It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing\n",
      "for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly,\n",
      "and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it. At last the\n",
      "third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a clank of\n",
      "chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself. \"It would be\n",
      "interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,\" thought Anna,\n",
      "looking angrily at him. She looked past the lady out of the window at\n",
      "the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood\n",
      "on the platform. The train, jerking at regular intervals at the\n",
      "junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, a\n",
      "signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly and\n",
      "evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails. The window was\n",
      "lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the\n",
      "curtain. Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of\n",
      "the train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, what did I stop at? That I couldn't conceive a position in which\n",
      "life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable, and\n",
      "that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other. And\n",
      "when one sees the truth, what is one to do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him,\"\n",
      "said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with\n",
      "her phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The words seemed an answer to Anna's thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To escape from what worries him,\" repeated Anna. And glancing at the\n",
      "red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife\n",
      "considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and\n",
      "encouraged her in that idea of herself. Anna seemed to see all their\n",
      "history and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light\n",
      "upon them. But there was nothing interesting in them, and she pursued\n",
      "her thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm very much worried, and that's what reason was given me for, to\n",
      "escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when there's\n",
      "nothing more to look at, when it's sickening to look at it all? But how?\n",
      "Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking,\n",
      "those young men in that train? why are they talking, why are they\n",
      "laughing? It's all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all cruelty!...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of\n",
      "passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she stood\n",
      "on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and what\n",
      "she meant to do. Everything that had seemed to her possible before was\n",
      "now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of hideous\n",
      "people who would not leave her alone. One moment porters ran up to her\n",
      "proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels on the\n",
      "planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people meeting\n",
      "her dodged past on the wrong side. Remembering that she had meant to go\n",
      "on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter and asked if\n",
      "her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute, to\n",
      "meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is the coachman like?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and\n",
      "cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so\n",
      "successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a\n",
      "letter. She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry your note did not reach me. I will be home at ten,\"\n",
      "Vronsky had written carelessly....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that's what I expected!\" she said to herself with an evil smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, you can go home then,\" she said softly, addressing Mihail.\n",
      "She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart's beating hindered\n",
      "her breathing. \"No, I won't let you make me miserable,\" she thought\n",
      "menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made her\n",
      "suffer, and she walked along the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads, staring\n",
      "at her and making some remarks about her dress. \"Real,\" they said of the\n",
      "lace she was wearing. The young men would not leave her in peace. Again\n",
      "they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh shouting\n",
      "something in an unnatural voice. The station-master coming up asked her\n",
      "whether she was going by train. A boy selling kvas never took his eyes\n",
      "off her. \"My God! where am I to go?\" she thought, going farther and\n",
      "farther along the platform. At the end she stopped. Some ladies and\n",
      "children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in\n",
      "their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she reached them.\n",
      "She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the\n",
      "platform. A luggage train was coming in. The platform began to sway, and\n",
      "she fancied she was in the train again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she\n",
      "had first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do. With a rapid,\n",
      "light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails\n",
      "and stopped quite near the approaching train.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains\n",
      "and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and\n",
      "trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the\n",
      "very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There,\" she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage,\n",
      "at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers--\"there, in the\n",
      "very middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it\n",
      "reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand\n",
      "delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment. She had to\n",
      "wait for the next carriage. A feeling such as she had known when about\n",
      "to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed\n",
      "herself. That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series\n",
      "of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had\n",
      "covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her\n",
      "for an instant with all its bright past joys. But she did not take her\n",
      "eyes from the wheels of the second carriage. And exactly at the moment\n",
      "when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red\n",
      "bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands\n",
      "under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once,\n",
      "dropped on to her knees. And at the same instant she was terror-stricken\n",
      "at what she was doing. \"Where am I? What am I doing? What for?\" She\n",
      "tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless\n",
      "struck her on the head and rolled her on her back. \"Lord, forgive me\n",
      "all!\" she said, feeling it impossible to struggle. A peasant muttering\n",
      "something was working at the iron above her. And the light by which she\n",
      "had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil,\n",
      "flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that\n",

      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch's life had not been uneventful during this time. A\n",
      "year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years' labor,\n",
      "\"Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe\n",
      "and Russia.\" Several sections of this book and its introduction had\n",
      "appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas of\n",
      "the work could not be completely novel to the public. But still Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to\n",
      "make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a\n",
      "revolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir in\n",
      "the scientific world.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been\n",
      "published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned\n",
      "indifference answered his friends' inquiries as to how the book was\n",
      "going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was\n",
      "selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained\n",
      "attention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the\n",
      "world and in literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression\n",
      "whatever could be detected. His friends who were specialists and\n",
      "savants, occasionally--unmistakably from politeness--alluded to it. The\n",
      "rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned\n",
      "subject, did not talk of it at all. And society generally--just now\n",
      "especially absorbed in other things--was absolutely indifferent. In the\n",
      "press, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for\n",
      "writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer\n",
      "Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to\n",

      "through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious\n",

      "\n",
      "The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a\n",

      "relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete\n",
      "respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article. The\n",
      "article was awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which\n",
      "could not possibly be put on it. But he had selected quotations so\n",
      "adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously\n",
      "scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole\n",
      "book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even--as\n",
      "suggested by marks of interrogation--used appropriately, and that the\n",
      "author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the\n",
      "subject. And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would\n",
      "not have disowned such wit himself. But that was just what was so awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic's arguments, he did\n",
      "not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were\n",
      "ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every\n",
      "detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Didn't I offend him in some way?\" Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.\n",

      "And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about\n",
      "something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found\n",
      "the clue to explain the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the\n",

      "Sergey Ivanovitch's position was still more difficult from the fact\n",

      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he\n",
      "did not know what use to make of his energy. Conversations in drawing\n",
      "rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees--everywhere where talk\n",
      "was possible--took up part of his time. But being used for years to town\n",
      "life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less experienced\n",
      "younger brother did, when he was in Moscow. He had a great deal of\n",
      "leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the\n",
      "failure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting\n",
      "sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions,\n",
      "and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the\n",
      "Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested\n",
      "society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise\n",
      "this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of\n",
      "or written about just now but the Servian War. Everything that the idle\n",
      "crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the\n",
      "Slavonic States. Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies' dresses,\n",
      "beer, restaurants--everything testified to sympathy with the Slavonic\n",
      "peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch differed on various points. He saw that the Slavonic question\n",
      "had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one\n",
      "another in providing society with an object and an occupation. He saw,\n",
      "too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of\n",
      "self-interest and self-advertisement. He recognized that the newspapers\n",
      "published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the\n",
      "sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another. He saw that\n",
      "in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and\n",
      "shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a\n",
      "sense of injury--generals without armies, ministers not in the ministry,\n",
      "journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers. He saw\n",
      "that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd. But he\n",
      "saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting all\n",
      "classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize. The massacre of\n",
      "men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic race, excited\n",
      "sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors. And\n",
      "the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great\n",
      "cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in\n",
      "word but in deed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.\n",
      "That was the manifestation of public opinion. The public had definitely\n",
      "expressed its desire. The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch\n",
      "said, found expression. And the more he worked in this cause, the more\n",
      "incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume\n",
      "vast dimensions, to create an epoch.\n",
      "\n",
      "He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause,\n",
      "and forgot to think about his book. His whole time now was engrossed by\n",
      "it, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and\n",
      "appeals addressed to him. He worked the whole spring and part of the\n",
      "summer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his\n",
      "brother's in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the\n",
      "people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that\n",
      "uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in\n",
      "the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded. Katavasov had long\n",

      "loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man. He was\n",
      "unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at his\n",
      "school. Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian military\n",
      "jacket of the Guards uniform. He was listening with a smile to the\n",
      "hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up. The third, in an\n",

      "and effeminate and sickly. He was obviously convinced, especially now\n",
      "after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action, and he bragged\n",
      "of it in the most unpleasant way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon\n",

      "All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and\n",
      "when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would\n",

      "\n",
      "The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns. He knew what\n",
      "makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of those\n",
      "persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on\n",
      "the journey, he considered them poor soldiers. Moreover, he lived in a\n",
      "district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier had\n",
      "volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would\n",
      "employ as a laborer. But knowing by experience that in the present\n",
      "condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion\n",
      "opposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers\n",
      "unfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.\n",
      "\n",

      "had been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points. And so\n",

      "anyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him. And not for\n",
      "one minute could we leave him alone. We took away everything he could\n",
      "have used against himself. We lived on the ground floor, but there was\n",
      "no reckoning on anything. You know, of course, that he had shot himself\n",
      "once already on her account,\" she said, and the old lady's eyelashes\n",

      "\"Ah, don't speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.\n",

      "idea that she was close by at the station. In the evening I had only\n",
      "just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself\n",
      "under the train. Something seemed to strike me at once. I knew it was\n",
      "she. The first thing I said was, he was not to be told. But they'd told\n",
      "him already. His coachman was there and saw it all. When I ran into his\n",
      "room, he was beside himself--it was fearful to see him. He didn't say a\n",
      "word, but galloped off there. I don't know to this day what happened\n",
      "there, but he was brought back at death's door. I shouldn't have known\n",
      "him. _Prostration complete,_ the doctor said. And that was followed\n",
      "almost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!\" said the countess with a wave of\n",
      "her hand. \"It was an awful time! No, say what you will, she was a bad\n",
      "woman. Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions? It was all\n",
      "to show herself something out of the way. Well, and that she did do. She\n",

      "to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey. For him, for\n",
      "her husband, it was easier, anyway. She had set him free. But my poor\n",
      "son was utterly given up to her. He had thrown up everything, his\n",
      "career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose\n",
      "she made his ruin complete. No, say what you will, her very death was\n",
      "the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God forgive me, but\n",

      "\"Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are\n",
      "after all essential, with anyone prepared to see you. But that's as you\n",

      "suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin\n",
      "garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately\n",
      "convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he is as good as\n",

      "honeycomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should think so! You should have seen what was going on at the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"With the Turks,\" Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But the prince is not speaking of help,\" said Levin, coming to the\n",
      "assistance of his father-in-law, \"but of war. The prince says that\n",

      "government.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well now, well, what's your own theory?\" Katavasov said to Levin with a\n",
      "smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion. \"Why have not private\n",
      "persons the right to do so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, my theory's this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and\n",
      "awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can\n",
      "individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;\n",
      "that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this,\n",
      "and is driven inevitably into war. On the other hand, both political\n",
      "science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and\n",
      "especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their\n",
      "personal individual will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began\n",
      "speaking at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the\n",
      "government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the\n",
      "public asserts its will,\" said Katavasov.\n",
      "\n",
      "But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer. His\n",
      "brows contracted at Katavasov's words and he said something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You don't put the matter in its true light. There is no question here\n",
      "of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian\n",
      "feeling. Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being\n",
      "massacred. Even supposing they were not our brothers nor\n",
      "fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is\n",
      "aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.\n",
      "Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a\n",
      "woman or a child--I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war\n",
      "had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and\n",
      "protect the victim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I should not kill them,\" said Levin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, you would kill them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know. If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the\n",

      "is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the\n",
      "Slavonic peoples.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,\" said Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure. \"There are traditions still\n",
      "extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the\n",
      "yoke of the 'unclean sons of Hagar.' The people have heard of the\n",
      "sufferings of their brethren and have spoken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps so,\" said Levin evasively; \"but I don't see it. I'm one of the\n",
      "people myself, and I don't feel it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here am I too,\" said the old prince. \"I've been staying abroad and\n",
      "reading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian\n",
      "atrocities, I couldn't make out why it was all the Russians were all of\n",
      "a sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn't feel the\n",
      "slightest affection for them. I was very much upset, thought I was a\n",
      "monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me. But since I\n",
      "have been here, my mind's been set at rest. I see that there are people\n",
      "besides me who're only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic\n",
      "brethren. Here's Konstantin too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch;\n",
      "\"it's not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia--the whole\n",
      "people--has expressed its will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But excuse me, I don't see that. The people don't know anything about\n",
      "it, if you come to that,\" said the old prince.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, papa!... how can you say that? And last Sunday in church?\" said\n",
      "Dolly, listening to the conversation. \"Please give me a cloth,\" she said\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But what was it in church on Sunday? The priest had been told to read\n",

      "well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they\n",
      "couldn't say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is\n",
      "always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense\n",

      "the old bee-keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair,\n",
      "stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height\n",

      "Sergey Ivanovitch's words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, then, ask him. He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing,\"\n",

      "we to fight for the Christians?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What should we think? Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought\n",
      "for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things. It's clearer for him to\n",

      "\"I don't need to ask,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch, \"we have seen and are\n",
      "seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve a\n",
      "just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly\n",
      "express their thought and aim. They bring their halfpence or go\n",
      "themselves and say directly what for. What does it mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It means, to my thinking,\" said Levin, who was beginning to get warm,\n",
      "\"that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not\n",
      "hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste,\n",
      "ne'er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere--to Pogatchev's\n",
      "bands, to Khiva, to Serbia...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I tell you that it's not a case of hundreds or of ne'er-do-wells, but\n",

      "much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune.\n",
      "\"And what of the subscriptions? In this case it is a whole people\n",
      "directly expressing their will.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That word 'people' is so vague,\" said Levin. \"Parish clerks, teachers,\n",
      "and one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it's all about.\n",
      "The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing\n",
      "their will, haven't the faintest idea what there is for them to express\n",
      "their will about. What right have we to say that this is the people's\n",
      "will?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical\n",

      "has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does\n",
      "not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of reaching\n",
      "that. It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart. I won't speak of\n",
      "those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people,\n",
      "and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at society\n",
      "in the narrow sense. All the most diverse sections of the educated\n",
      "public, hostile before, are merged in one. Every division is at an end,\n",

      "\"Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,\" said the prince.\n",
      "\"That's true. But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Frogs or no frogs, I'm not the editor of a paper and I don't want to\n",

      "answered, but the old prince interrupted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, about that unanimity, that's another thing, one may say,\" said\n",

      "He's got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or\n",
      "other, I don't remember. Only there's nothing to do in it--why, Dolly,\n",
      "it's no secret!--and a salary of eight thousand. You try asking him\n",
      "whether his post is of use, he'll prove to you that it's most necessary.\n",

      "utility of eight thousand roubles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the\n",
      "post,\" said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the prince's remark\n",
      "to be ill-timed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is with the unanimity of the press. That's been explained to me:\n",
      "as soon as there's war their incomes are doubled. How can they help\n",
      "believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and\n",
      "all that?\"\n",

      "\"I don't care for many of the papers, but that's unjust,\" said Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would only make one condition,\" pursued the old prince. \"Alphonse\n",
      "Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: 'You consider war\n",

      "in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of every storm,\n",
      "of every attack, to lead them all!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A nice lot the editors would make!\" said Katavasov, with a loud roar,\n",

      "Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work,\"\n",
      "said he. \"And men of thought are doing their work when they express\n",
      "public opinion. And the single-hearted and full expression of public\n",
      "opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at\n",
      "the same time. Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we\n",
      "have heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as\n",
      "one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that\n",
      "is a great step and a proof of strength.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it's not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,\" said Levin\n",
      "timidly. \"The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices\n",
      "for their soul, but not for murder,\" he added, instinctively connecting\n",
      "the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For their soul? That's a most puzzling expression for a natural science\n",
      "man, do you understand? What sort of thing is the soul?\" said Katavasov,\n",
      "smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you know!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, by God, I haven't the faintest idea!\" said Katavasov with a loud\n",

      "\"'I bring not peace, but a sword,' says Christ,\" Sergey Ivanovitch\n",
      "rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest\n",
      "thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin most.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so, no doubt,\" the old man repeated again. He was standing near\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ah, my dear fellow, you're defeated, utterly defeated!\" cried Katavasov\n",
      "good-humoredly.\n",

      "failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I can't argue with them,\" he thought; \"they wear impenetrable\n",
      "armor, while I'm naked.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov, and\n",
      "he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them. What they\n",
      "advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin.\n",
      "He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his brother, had\n",
      "the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib\n",
      "volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers\n",
      "were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which\n",
      "was expressed in vengeance and murder. He could not admit this, because\n",
      "he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom\n",
      "he was living, nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider\n",
      "himself one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of\n",
      "all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know what is\n",
      "for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that this general\n",
      "good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of\n",
      "right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he\n",
      "could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.\n",
      "He said as Mihalitch did and the people, who had expressed their feeling\n",
      "in the traditional invitations of the Varyagi: \"Be princes and rule over\n",
      "us. Gladly we promise complete submission. All the labor, all\n",
      "humiliations, all sacrifices we take upon ourselves; but we will not\n",

      "He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide,\n",
      "then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement\n",
      "in favor of the Slavonic peoples? But these were merely thoughts that\n",
      "could settle nothing. One thing could be seen beyond doubt--that was\n",
      "that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey\n",
      "Ivanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it. And Levin ceased\n",
      "speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that\n",

      "leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch\n",
      "branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one\n",
      "side--acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops. The\n",
      "peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the\n",
      "servants' quarters. The streaming rain had already flung its white veil\n",
      "over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was\n",

      "there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault\n",
      "of heaven seemed crashing overhead. Opening his blinded eyes, Levin\n",
      "gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the\n",
      "copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of\n",
      "the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its\n",
      "position. \"Can it have been struck?\" Levin hardly had time to think\n",
      "when, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the\n",

      "for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing room and was alone,\n",

      "theories of the significance of the Slav element in the history of the\n",
      "world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own\n",
      "soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same\n",

      "\n",
      "He did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of\n",
      "thought--that he did not need. He fell back at once into the feeling\n",
      "which had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts, and he\n",
      "found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than\n",
      "before. He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to find\n",
      "comforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find\n",
      "the feeling. Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was\n",
      "keener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out\n",
      "in the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered. \"Yes, looking at the\n",
      "sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I\n",
      "thought something, I shirked facing something,\" he mused. \"But whatever\n",
      "it was, there can be no disproving it! I have but to think, and all will\n",
      "come clear!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had\n",
      "shirked facing. It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His\n",
      "revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to\n",
      "the Christian church alone? What relation to this revelation have the\n",
      "beliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.\n",
      "Hearing her husband's footstep, she turned towards him, summoning him to\n",
      "her with her smile. With one hand she was supporting the fat baby that\n",
      "lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she\n",
      "squeezed the sponge over him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it\n",
      "was completely successful. The cook, sent for with this object, bent\n",
      "over the baby. He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly. Kitty bent\n",
      "down to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on\n",
      "the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound\n",
      "with his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their\n",

      "You said you had no feeling for him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What! disappointed in him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more. I\n",

      "then instead of that--disgust, pity...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put\n",
      "back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving\n",

      "\n",

      "Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once\n",
      "to the thought, in which there was something not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of going into the drawing room, where he heard voices, he\n",
      "stopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed\n",
      "up at the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there\n",
      "were no clouds. The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the\n",
      "sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that\n",
      "quarter. Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in\n",
      "the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and the\n",
      "Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst. At each flash of\n",
      "lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as\n",
      "soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places as\n",
      "though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it perplexes me?\" Levin said to himself, feeling\n",
      "beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul,\n",
      "though he did not know it yet. \"Yes, the one unmistakable, incontestable\n",
      "manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and wrong, which has\n",
      "come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in myself, and in\n",
      "the recognition of which--I don't make myself, but whether I will or\n",
      "not--I am made one with other men in one body of believers, which is\n",
      "called the church. Well, but the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians,\n",
      "the Buddhists--what of them?\" he put to himself the question he had\n",
      "feared to face. \"Can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of\n",
      "that highest blessing without which life has no meaning?\" He pondered a\n",
      "moment, but immediately corrected himself. \"But what am I questioning?\"\n",
      "he said to himself. \"I am questioning the relation to Divinity of all\n",
      "the different religions of all mankind. I am questioning the universal\n",
      "manifestation of God to all the world with all those misty blurs. What\n",
      "am I about? To me individually, to my heart has been revealed a\n",
      "knowledge beyond all doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am\n",
      "obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't I know that the stars don't move?\" he asked himself, gazing at\n",
      "the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig\n",
      "of the birch-tree. \"But looking at the movements of the stars, I can't\n",
      "picture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I'm right in saying\n",
      "that the stars move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if\n",
      "they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of\n",
      "the earth? All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the\n",
      "distances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies\n",
      "are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a\n",
      "stationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has\n",
      "been so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be always\n",
      "alike, and can always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of the\n",
      "astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on\n",
      "observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a\n",
      "single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not\n",
      "founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always\n",
      "alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and\n",
      "which can always be trusted in my soul. The question of other religions\n",
      "and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no\n",
      "possibility of deciding.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you haven't gone in then?\" he heard Kitty's voice all at once, as\n",
      "she came by the same way to the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it? you're not worried about anything?\" she said, looking\n",
      "intently at his face in the starlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not\n",
      "hidden the stars and revealed it. In that flash she saw his face\n",
      "distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She understands,\" he thought; \"she knows what I'm thinking about. Shall\n",
      "I tell her or not? Yes, I'll tell her.\" But at the moment he was about\n",
      "to speak, she began speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kostya! do something for me,\" she said; \"go into the corner room and\n",
      "see if they've made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch. I can't very\n",
      "well. See if they've put the new wash stand in it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well, I'll go directly,\" said Levin, standing up and kissing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'd better not speak of it,\" he thought, when she had gone in\n",
      "before him. \"It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me,\n",
      "and not to be put into words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and\n",
      "enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for\n",
      "my child. There was no surprise in this either. Faith--or not faith--I\n",
      "don't know what it is--but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly\n",
      "through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the coachman,\n",
      "falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions tactlessly; there\n",
      "will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and\n",
      "other people, even my wife; I shall still go on scolding her for my own\n",
      "terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall still be as unable to\n",
      "understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall still go on praying;\n",
      "but my life now, my whole life apart from anything that can happen to\n",
      "me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it was before, but it\n",

    "## Making training mini-batches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To train on this data, we also want to create mini-batches for training. Remember that we want our batches to be multiple sequences of some desired number of sequence steps. Considering a simple example, our batches would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/sequence_batching@1x.png\" width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll take the encoded characters (passed in as the `arr` parameter) and split them into multiple sequences, given by `n_seqs` (also refered to as \"batch size\" in other places). Each of those sequences will be `n_steps` long.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Batches\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The first thing we need to do is discard some of the text so we only have completely full batches. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Each batch contains $N \\times M$ characters, where $N$ is the batch size (the number of sequences) and $M$ is the number of steps. Then, to get the total number of batches, $K$, we can make from the array `arr`, you divide the length of `arr` by the number of characters per batch. Once you know the number of batches, you can get the total number of characters to keep from `arr`, $N * M * K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. After that, we need to split `arr` into $N$ sequences. ** \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this using `arr.reshape(size)` where `size` is a tuple containing the dimensions sizes of the reshaped array. We know we want $N$ sequences, so let's make that the size of the first dimension. For the second dimension, you can use `-1` as a placeholder in the size, it'll fill up the array with the appropriate data for you. After this, you should have an array that is $N \\times (M * K)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Now that we have this array, we can iterate through it to get our batches. **\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is each batch is a $N \\times M$ window on the $N \\times (M * K)$ array. For each subsequent batch, the window moves over by `n_steps`. We also want to create both the input and target arrays. Remember that the targets are the inputs shifted over one character. The way I like to do this window is use `range` to take steps of size `n_steps` from $0$ to `arr.shape[1]`, the total number of steps in each sequence. That way, the integers you get from `range` always point to the start of a batch, and each window is `n_steps` wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **TODO:** Write the code for creating batches in the function below. The exercises in this notebook _will not be easy_. I've provided a notebook with solutions alongside this notebook. If you get stuck, checkout the solutions. The most important thing is that you don't copy and paste the code into here, **type out the solution code yourself.**"

    "\n",
    "> ## Tips and Tricks\n",
    "\n",
    ">### Monitoring Validation Loss vs. Training Loss\n",
    ">If you're somewhat new to Machine Learning or Neural Networks it can take a bit of expertise to get good models. The most important quantity to keep track of is the difference between your training loss (printed during training) and the validation loss (printed once in a while when the RNN is run on the validation data (by default every 1000 iterations)). In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - If your training loss is much lower than validation loss then this means the network might be **overfitting**. Solutions to this are to decrease your network size, or to increase dropout. For example you could try dropout of 0.5 and so on.\n",
    "> - If your training/validation loss are about equal then your model is **underfitting**. Increase the size of your model (either number of layers or the raw number of neurons per layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Approximate number of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "> The two most important parameters that control the model are `n_hidden` and `n_layers`. I would advise that you always use `n_layers` of either 2/3. The `n_hidden` can be adjusted based on how much data you have. The two important quantities to keep track of here are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The number of parameters in your model. This is printed when you start training.\n",
    "> - The size of your dataset. 1MB file is approximately 1 million characters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">These two should be about the same order of magnitude. It's a little tricky to tell. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I have a 100MB dataset and I'm using the default parameter settings (which currently print 150K parameters). My data size is significantly larger (100 mil >> 0.15 mil), so I expect to heavily underfit. I am thinking I can comfortably afford to make `n_hidden` larger.\n",
    "> - I have a 10MB dataset and running a 10 million parameter model. I'm slightly nervous and I'm carefully monitoring my validation loss. If it's larger than my training loss then I may want to try to increase dropout a bit and see if that helps the validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Best models strategy\n",
    "\n",
    ">The winning strategy to obtaining very good models (if you have the compute time) is to always err on making the network larger (as large as you're willing to wait for it to compute) and then try different dropout values (between 0,1). Whatever model has the best validation performance (the loss, written in the checkpoint filename, low is good) is the one you should use in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It is very common in deep learning to run many different models with many different hyperparameter settings, and in the end take whatever checkpoint gave the best validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">By the way, the size of your training and validation splits are also parameters. Make sure you have a decent amount of data in your validation set or otherwise the validation performance will be noisy and not very informative."
